Hasbro started packaging a DVD of this episode with certain pony toys in January 2012.   Originally, the episode involved Applejack losing acuity from “applebumping”, using her head to bump apples off trees. “Applebumping” was replaced with ""applebucking"" (kicking the trunk of apple trees to knock the apples off the trees).  Long before the episode reached the animation process, a scene where Applejack attempts to help   was cut because it was repetitive and took up too much time. According to writer  , that scene was cut by the second draft.    At  ,   and   survey the huge apple harvest awaiting them. With Big McIntosh injured, Applejack decides to harvest the crop of apples by herself, despite her brother's warning that it's a huge task for just one pony.

Impressed by Applejack's loyalty and reliability, the citizens host a ceremony in her honor.   tries to give a speech, but she is interrupted by  ,  , and  —who express happiness at the prospect of working with Applejack on various tasks in the near future—as well as   who steps up to deliver a short speech of her own. A visibly exhausted Applejack arrives late to the ceremony to collect her trophy. She has bags under her eyes and yawns frequently. Later on, Twilight goes to the apple farm to find Applejack. Applejack explains that ""Applebuck Season"" is when the apples must be harvested. When Twilight asks about her  , Applejack says that they only stayed at Sweet Apple Acres for the   and are too busy harvesting their own crops. Twilight offers to help, but Applejack stubbornly refuses.   Applejack, having promised to help out her friends, shows up late for her appointment with Rainbow Dash. Applejack's task is to jump from a platform onto one end of a catapult, launching Dash into the air to practice flips and spins. Her vision blurry from fatigue, Applejack keeps missing her end of the catapult. She lands on the catapult in one last attempt, but the unprepared Dash is sent flying and crash-lands on the   balcony. Twilight guesses that Applejack is involved and returns to Sweet Apple Acres to offer help. Applejack has difficulty hearing after hitting her head on a branch, but still declines.   Later, Applejack bakes muffins with Pinkie Pie at   while   are away. Applejack's fatigue causes her to misunderstand her friend's instruction, and she substitutes potato chips for chocolate chips, regular soda for baking soda, a cup of sour lemon juice for a cup of flour, and earthworms for wheat germ. When the muffins are baked, Pinkie Pie hands them out to a crowd of ponies, one of whom is  . She exclaims ""Muffins!"", making it her first line on the show, though  's and  's mouth movements also match the line. The scene wipes into a sick-tent where many ponies lie sick from eating the baked goods, which Pinkie Pie calls ""baked bads."" Spike, however, gleefully eats the discarded muffins, even one with a wriggling worm in it. Once more, Applejack refuses Twilight's help. Twilight is annoyed at Applejack for being ""as stubborn as a mule"", and says ""No offense"" to a nearby  .   For her final task, Applejack meets Fluttershy in the forest to help round up baby rabbits for Fluttershy's bunny census. Fluttershy tells Applejack to be gentle, but Applejack's rough attitude and Winona's barking frighten the bunnies. Applejack and Winona corner the terrified bunnies, who freak out and stampede into Ponyville, where they eat most of the town's plants, ruin the town’s gardens, and make Fluttershy's census impossible to finish. Seeing this, Twilight decides enough is enough and goes to confront Applejack once and for all.   At the orchard, Twilight tells Applejack that her stubbornness caused as many problems with her friends as with her and that she really needs help. Applejack thinks she's finally finished harvesting, but Big McIntosh arrives to point out that she has only harvested part of the apples. Applejack faints from shock and exhaustion. When she regains consciousness, Twilight tells her that, although she respects the Apple family ways, Applejack must put ""a little of [her] stubborn pride aside"". Applejack finally gives in and asks for her friends' help, which makes the harvesting more efficient. When the friends take a break, Applejack serves them apple juice, thanking them and apologizing for being so stubborn. Twilight realizes that it is just as okay to accept help from friends as it is to give help.   comes by to offer them the worm-filled muffins he found in the garbage, and the disgusted ponies walk off as the episode ends.

In this episode,   and   bond by playing pranks on the other ponies, but when Rainbow Dash's old friend,   the griffon, shows up for a visit, Pinkie gets left out. The title is a play on the phrase ""given the brush-off"", which is an abrupt and rude dismissal.   Comcast's   television guide referred to   as Grizelda when this episode was first scheduled to air. Hubworld's listing of the episode also referred to Gilda as Grizelda. Grizelda was Gilda's original name,  and was used in an audition script for  . The Zap2it,  Dish Network,  and Bright House Networks  episode descriptions for the episode are in Spanish. Similarly, the Zap2it  and LocateTV  descriptions for the Spanish version(s) of the episode are in English.    The episode starts with   and   spending time in a park, with Pinkie enthusiastically relating some story about  's aerial acrobatics to Twilight, who is reading a book and not paying Pinkie much attention. Pinkie spots Rainbow flying up above and calls to her, but Dash tells her ""not now"". Pinkie pursues Dash and calls out to her, until Dash slams into a mountainside and slides down next to Pinkie, who tells her she was going to warn her about it.    Pinkie Pie starts asking around   for the whereabouts of Rainbow Dash. Once she finds her, Dash tries to escape, but Pinkie Pie catches up with her instantly whenever she stops. After several failed hiding spots, Dash gives up and asks what she wants. Pinkie reveals that she was trying to find her so she could help in playing a prank on  . Using a nearby thundercloud, they wait for the baby dragon to exit the town square pavilion. Once Spike is out, upon a signal from Pinkie, Dash kicks the cloud to ignite a thunderous boom, scaring him. The scare causes him to hiccup repeatedly, making him breathe his   fire at a set of scrolls and transporting them to an unsuspecting  .   After making sure he is okay, the two commence a pranking spree on the rest of their friends. They use water colors on the apples in some of  's apple trees, switch Twilight's pen ink with disappearing ink, and use sneezing powder on  . The ""victims"" are annoyed but still amused by the good-natured practical jokes. At a nearby lake, when Pinkie learns that Dash sees   as their target for a fake squirting turtle toy, she immediately stops her. She warns Dash that Fluttershy is too sensitive for even the most harmless of pranks. The two end the day by pranking each other instead.   The next day, Pinkie Pie arrives wearing an arrow head band, a pair of glasses with a red clown nose, a droopy mustache, and a party kazoo near Rainbow Dash's cloud-house in the sky, where she meets  , Dash's old griffon friend from Junior Speedster Flight Camp. Pinkie Pie has prepared another series of pranks for her and Dash to pull. Gilda reminds Dash about a promised flying session, and Dash excuses herself, promising to hang out with Pinkie Pie later. Pinkie accepts this, but as she tries to catch up to the two in the clouds later, Gilda intercepts her and tells her to buzz off now that she is around to keep Dash company. Pinkie Pie goes to Twilight Sparkle at the   for advice about Gilda's mean behavior, but Twilight believes that Pinkie Pie is simply jealous of Gilda. The only advice she can give Pinkie is to try to improve her own attitude. Pinkie is upset at Twilight's refusal to take her side but reflects that maybe Twilight's assessment is true and enjoys a milkshake alone at  .    Rainbow Dash and Gilda show up in town and, not noticing Pinkie Pie, part ways briefly so Rainbow Dash can attend to some weather jobs. When Pinkie observes Gilda scaring   and stealing an apple from a produce stand, she tries her best to justify the situation. The last straw falls when the griffon roars at and drives to tears a well-meaning Fluttershy, who was guiding a family of ducks. Fluttershy flies away and passes two ponies on the way making strange faces, which an animator on the show described as a "" -sorta look"".  Tired of the bird-lion's mean streak, Pinkie Pie vows to fix the problem ""Pinkie Pie-style.""    This entails throwing a welcoming party at Sugarcube Corner in Gilda's honor. At the party, the griffon is greeted by Pinkie's joy buzzer handshake. Gilda warns Pinkie that she knows what the pony is up to, but the latter simply brushes it aside and officially starts the party by having everyone in the party welcome Gilda. After the party starts, Gilda falls for most of the pranks set up for the party, to which she hides her growing irritation from the other ponies, including Dash.  The griffon strongly suspects that Pinkie Pie was the mastermind behind the party pranks. The pink pony then preps the griffon for ""Pin the Tail on the Pony"". As she guides the guest of honor to the picture, Gilda suspects this is yet another prank and goes the other direction, resulting in slipping over a fallen piece of cake and having the 'tail on the other end'.   Gilda finally loses her temper, calling all the attendees at the party ""dweebs"" and proclaiming Pinkie Pie as ""Queen Lame-o"" for setting up all the pranks. She then attempts to bail the party with Dash at her side, but Rainbow Dash doesn't move after seeing Gilda's true nature. To everyone's surprise, Rainbow Dash reveals that   is the one who set up all the pranks (not   meant for Gilda). Contrary to the bird's view of the party as a way to get back at her, Pinkie reveals that it was meant to improve the griffon's sour attitude. Disappointed over her old friend's mean behavior towards her new friends, Dash tells Gilda to go find some ""new cool friends someplace else"" if being cool is all she cares about. Rather than apologize for her behavior and having no proper response to this, Gilda calls Dash a 'flip-flop' and storms out, slamming the door behind her. Rainbow Dash then apologizes to the party attendees for Gilda's behavior, and she and Pinkie Pie make up with a joy buzzer handshake. Twilight Sparkle apologizes to Pinkie Pie for accusing her of misjudging Gilda, and learns that, rather than try to influence who your friends spend time with, you yourself should try to be a good friend, and trust that the true face of a false friend will eventually be revealed through their behavior. While sending her   at the end of the episode, Twilight plays a prank of her own by tricking Princess Celestia into trying to write with disappearing ink.      "

Trixie makes the rope imitate a hypnotic snake that hog-ties Applejack. Rainbow Dash then gathers moisture from clouds to create a mini-rainbow, but Trixie uses magic to whirl the rainbow into a funnel and trap Rainbow Dash in it, spinning her around until she is dizzy. Rarity declines the challenge, saying that she is ""above all this nonsense"". But when Trixie insults her mane, she decides to demonstrate elegance by creating a costume out of stage curtains.

Rarity runs off in humiliation, crying, “Such an awful, awful color!” A green-haired variation of   frowns and says, “Well I never!” Spike tries to convince Twilight to confront the arrogant unicorn. Trixie overhears him and challenges Twilight, but Twilight runs away.

The colts want to hear how she defeated an  , but Trixie brushes them off, telling them she’s exhausted. A skeptical Spike meets the two colts, saying that proof is needed to verify Trixie's claim. Snips gets the idea of finding an ursa major in the Everfree Forest. Back at the library where Twilight is studying, Spike tries to convince her that she can use her magic to stand up to Trixie and help her friends. However, Twilight fears she would be no better than Trixie and might end up losing her friends by showing off. Spike is frustrated about the situation and leaves.    In the forest, Snips and Snails find a giant blue bear in a dark cave, but they accidentally wake it up and lead it back to Ponyville. They wake up Trixie, who panics upon seeing the bear. The bear crushes Trixie's trailer after Trixie runs away with the two colts. After a few failed attempts to stop it, Trixie finally confesses that she had never vanquished an ursa major before. Before the bear can wreak serious havoc on Ponyville, Twilight (who was alerted by Spike) finally uses her magic. Using the wind and cattails to play a lullaby, she soothes the creature. She levitates a water tower, fills it with milk by passing it through a barn full of cows, and feeds the milk to the bear. As the bear drifts off into a deep sleep, she magically carries it back to the forest.   Twilight’s friends dismiss Trixie as a loudmouth and praise Twilight’s magical abilities. Twilight asks her friends if they mind her magic tricks, and Applejack reassures her that her magic is a part of who she is, and that they are proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as their friend. Twilight explains that the bear was actually an ursa minor, a younger version of the ursa major. Refusing to admit she was outdone, Trixie says that Twilight will never have the same ""amazing, show-stopping ability"" as she does. Trixie conjures a puff of smoke that poorly conceals her hasty departure from the town. Rainbow Dash prepares to go after Trixie, but Twilight stops her and says, ""Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson.""    Twilight orders Snips and Snails to clean up the area as punishment for luring the ursa minor into town. With Spike's encouragement, she gives them and Spike mustaches. Later, in the library, Twilight writes a   to   that she should be proud of her magical talent, but also be aware of whether the situation is appropriate for magic. Twilight finally admits to Spike that she is the most talented unicorn in Ponyville, but ""it's nothing to brag about."" Spike is disappointed that Rarity did not go for his new look.

Believing the smoke may be emerging from a possible fire, Fluttershy rushes over to warn everyone but fails to get their attention due to her soft voice and lack of assertiveness, and because the ponies in town are too occupied with their activities:   trying to break a ball-bouncing record,   organizing a celebration for when said record is broken, and other ponies conversing amongst themselves.

Twilight and her friends are tasked with taking care of the problem.   There's a short montage where Twilight's friends prepare for their journey, which is heavily influenced by 1970s and '80s action television shows and films. Rainbow Dash stripes a red, white and green pattern onto her cheeks,   packs money and apples, Pinkie Pie has sunglasses and balloons exploding from her bag (she giggles then says ""I mean GRRRRRRRRR""),   puts on a big hat with khaki coloring and Fluttershy comes out of her house wearing a football helmet, water wings and various other sports equipment, then jumps when the door closes. The group rendezvouses near the mountain the dragon has occupied. Fluttershy, who has exhibited very little enthusiasm for going after the dragon, tries to back out of the mission, and Rainbow Dash concurs, pointing out Fluttershy's timidness and worrying that she might slow them down, something she does repeatedly throughout the episode. However, Twilight Sparkle insists that the  ' talent of interacting with wild animals could be useful.   remains behind to look over the critters that Fluttershy usually takes care of, over her objections.   Initially, Rainbow Dash's skepticism seems justified. Upon hearing the dragon's distant snoring, Fluttershy's limbs lock up, rendering her unable to fly. Another snore makes her stiffly fall to the side, accompanied by a goat bleat, alluding to the tendency of some breeds of goat to stiffen after being startled. Applejack is forced to drag her the long way around to catch up to the other ponies. Later, after her ability to move on her own has returned, she still has trouble leaping over a narrow chasm, having to be encouraged by one of Pinkie Pie's  ; and a leaf falling on her back makes her cry out, inadvertently causing a rock slide that almost buries them and further extends their journey. They do eventually reach their destination: the cave where the dragon is resting. Twilight wants to go in with Fluttershy, in the hope that between the two of them, they can convince the dragon to leave. But Fluttershy says she is scared of fully-grown dragons. After a failed attempt to cheer Fluttershy on, her friends decide to finish the job without her.    Twilight tries to reason with the dragon, but is completely ignored. Then, Rarity tries to use her charm on it, but fails when she tries to lay claim to the dragon's jewels. Pinkie Pie enters the dragon's cave in a funny costume with balloons, flippers, giant glasses, and a party blower, but exits without success. Her costume is similar to Daffy Duck's body in a scene from the   cartoon  . All Rainbow Dash's brute force attempt accomplishes is making the dragon angry: it steps outside the cave and begins attacking the ponies. In the process, the ponies get knocked over, and Fluttershy's hiding place is destroyed, exposing her to the dragon. Looking at her dazed friends, she gains enough courage to fly up to the dragon and admonish him for what she calls his bullying. Cowed by Fluttershy's tone, the dragon tries to justify his anger by explaining that Rainbow Dash kicked him. Much to Rainbow Dash's confusion, Fluttershy apologizes for Dash's attack on the dragon, but also says that the dragon is bigger than the ponies and should be more considerate. She also admonishes him for sleeping in a place where his snoring could endanger the health of other creatures. The dragon weakly attempts to argue back, but Fluttershy won't let him. After being scolded so harshly that he bursts into tears, Fluttershy comforts him and convinces him to leave. The dragon leaves the mountain, and Fluttershy's friends congratulate her for standing up to him.    The episode cuts to Ponyville, where Spike is struggling to keep Angel in check. Twilight Sparkle relays a   to Princess Celestia that the mission was a success, and that she learned to never lose faith in her friends. Outside the library the main characters watch Rainbow Dash once again trying to beat the ball-bouncing record. Pinkie plays a prank on her and imitates a dragon's roar, which makes Rainbow briefly lock up in fear in a similar way to Fluttershy earlier in the episode. Still, the two Pegasi's roles are not entirely reversed; when Rainbow Dash blows another stray leaf onto Fluttershy's back, she freezes up and faints. The episode ends with the main characters laughing at the frozen Fluttershy.     "

This puts her at odds with  , who insists on taking the branches down. When Rarity voices her disapproval of Applejack making a mess, rain starts to fall, much to Rarity's further displeasure. Applejack suggests that Rarity use a bench to shield herself from the rain, but Rarity refuses out of an unwillingness to get her hooves muddy. As the two argue even more over their situation, the rain and wind pick up speed.  , noticing the two caught in the storm, offers them shelter in the library until the storm passes.    With   away in   on royal business, Twilight is alone for the evening, and sees this as an opportunity to have her very first slumber party. Rarity and Applejack are far from eager to spend the entire evening in each other's company, but find themselves unable to leave due to the worsening storm. After a brief argument about mud masks, they agree to try and get along so they don't ruin Twilight's first sleepover. Twilight is oblivious to Applejack and Rarity's silent bickering, checking off each game in her book as they're played. However, for each game played, the two grow more and more frustrated with each other.   During ghost stories, Rarity and Applejack suggest stories that allude to why they don't like each other before Twilight tells the legend of  , succeeding in scaring both of her friends. Applejack sickens Rarity by burping when they make s'mores. And in a game of Truth or Dare, Applejack and Rarity only dare each other to do humiliating things, such as Applejack daring Rarity to get her mane wet in the rain and Rarity daring Applejack to wear a gaudy, ridiculous outfit. Twilight, now sensing conflict, tries to move things along. Unfortunately, the conflict comes to a head during the next game: a pillow fight, which in no time turns into an all-out pillow   between Rarity and Applejack. Caught in the middle and bombarded with pillows, Twilight suggests that they call it a night and go to bed.    Applejack and Rarity's petty arguing continues even when the ponies try to go to bed. Exasperated by their constant back and forth, Twilight at last decides to intervene and voices how upset she is that her friends are fighting too much to have any fun, thereby ruining her slumber party. Just as Twilight asks if anything else could possibly go wrong, a nearby tree is hit by lightning and begins to topple towards a neighboring house. Applejack, not heeding a warning from Rarity, lassos the falling tree and instead of stabilizing it, sends it crashing through Twilight's bedroom window. Rarity focuses on cleaning up the mess of books and Applejack tries to push the tree back out of the window while Twilight desperately searches through her slumber party book for a section on dealing with fallen trees in the middle of the bedroom.   When Applejack fails at moving the tree out on her own, she eventually apologizes to Rarity for criticizing her attention to detail and convinces her to focus on helping with the bigger task instead. She gets Rarity to not worry so much about getting her hooves dirty. Rarity uses her unicorn   to turn the treetop into tiny bush sculptures, clearing the house at the cost of getting dirt all over herself. Applejack, at Rarity's insistence, proceeds to gently toss the broken tree trunk out of the window.  With the storm, and their differences, finally settled, Applejack, Rarity, and Twilight are finally able to have fun, rounding out the evening with a game of 20 Questions. Applejack and Rarity exchange apologies, and in the end, Twilight officially declares the slumber party a success, to her friends' delight.

While they speculate about where everyone could be,   fervently calls to them from  , telling them to get inside before ""she"" gets them. Inside, they find  ,  ,  , and  , who nervously explain that they are hiding from a strange hooded creature named  . The only pony not scared is Applejack's younger sister  , also present. According to the other  , no one in Ponyville knows what Zecora's reasons for visiting the town are, except that she does so monthly. They also know that she lives in the  , a self-preserving environment which is almost alien to Ponyville. After seeing her pull her hood down, Twilight concludes that Zecora is a zebra and not an ""odd-looking pony"". The gray and white in her strange mane are really her natural colors. According to books Twilight has read, Zecora's species is from ""a far away land"". Pinkie Pie shares a song with the others, profiling Zecora as an "" "".   While the ponies are busy discussing Zecora's nature, Apple Bloom decides to approach Zecora herself and slips out of the bakery. She follows Zecora to the  . Upon noticing Apple Bloom's absence, the other ponies decide to leave the house to search for her.   They find Apple Bloom when she is just behind Zecora, who is surrounded by many blue flowers. The zebra retreats to the forest, giving them a brief warning: ""Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!"" Applejack scoops Apple Bloom off the ground while the other ponies, save Twilight and Fluttershy, taunt the zebra and ignore her warning. On their way back, Twilight tries to explain to her friends the difference between   and Zecora's ""curses"" but to no avail. Twilight classifies the ""curses"" as harmless and fictional ""pony tales"". However, Applejack warns her that some ""pony tales"" are indeed true. As the ponies leave the forest, they all trot through the ""blue flowers"" except for Apple Bloom, who is carried out on Applejack's back.  During the night, Twilight dreams about Zecora and her friends' warnings of her evil. The next morning, Twilight wakes up after recalling everything her friends said about the strange zebra. As she brushes her hair, she is shocked to find her horn turned soft, wobbly, and covered in blue spots. She frantically searches for a book containing a way to fix her problem, or at least provide information on it, but she cannot find anything useful. Spike finds a book called   that she may have overlooked, but she insists that there's no need to even open it because it details superstitions or other useless information. Her friends arrive at the library, each with an ailment of their own. Pinkie Pie's now blue-spotted tongue is swollen to the point of hanging out of her mouth, and she can't speak intelligibly or without spitting. Rainbow Dash's wings have been inverted and moved from her back to her lower sides, preventing her from flying properly and causing her to crash constantly. Rarity's mane and tail are messy and her coat has grown so long that she cannot see or walk properly. Applejack has drastically shrunken in size and has to ride on Apple Bloom just to get to the library. Fluttershy is afflicted with a deep-sounding male voice. Spike laughs himself silly at the ponies and, in making good-natured fun of their misfortune, makes up nicknames for each pony:  Spike, however, can't immediately think of a proper name to make fun of Twilight's wobbly horn.   The ponies, with the exception of Twilight, conclude that Zecora has ""cursed"" or ""hexed"" them, and they resolve to confront her in the forest in hopes of finding a cure. But Apple Bloom, the only one that was not afflicted, believes she alone is to blame for the ponies' ailments and ventures ahead to find Zecora. As Apple Bloom leaves, Applejack wonders aloud where she is going and jumps into her tail. When the others notice Applejack is missing, they first worriedly check to see if they've stepped or sat on her. Upon realizing that Apple Bloom is also gone, the ponies realize she must have gone after Zecora again and set out in search of her. As the ponies leave, Fluttershy asks Spike if he is coming along, but he makes up an alibi to stay there to look for a cure. He manages to think up a joke-like nickname for Twilight Sparkle: ""Twilight Flopple"". On her way through the Everfree Forest, Applejack reveals herself in Apple Bloom's mane and orders her to turn around. Apple Bloom refuses and, realizing that her diminutive older sister can't stop her, places her on a tree branch she can't get down from before continuing on her way. When the others enter the forest later, Rainbow Dash crashes into the tree Applejack was left in, accidentally catching the tiny pony in her mouth. Applejack pulls herself out and quickly fashions a bit and reins from leaves, a stick, and some vine. She throws it on Rainbow Dash and, climbing onto her chest, helps to steer her in the right direction.    When the others finally reach Zecora's hut, they watch through her window as she mixes a strange concoction in her cauldron, chanting something in an unknown language. Pinkie gets Fluttershy to sing her "" "" song to point out that Zecora fits the profile in it. Twilight starts to wonder whether Zecora might be ""bad"" after all. When she overhears the zebra mentioning Apple Bloom, she concludes that Zecora is preparing a soup to eat her with. The four ponies scream in horror. Rainbow Dash and Applejack barge in and the other ponies follow suit in a rescue attempt, upsetting the cauldron and spilling its contents onto the floor. The hut is further wrecked by Rainbow Dash's uncoordinated flying. As the ponies loudly confront Zecora about her ""curse"", Apple Bloom arrives from behind them with packed saddle bags and tells them she is assisting Zecora by gathering ingredients. They both reveal that the brew Zecora had been making is a remedy for  , a poison ivy-like plant that causes ""laughable"" results to anyone who touches it. They had never been cursed but had been affected by the blue plants, and were too stubborn to heed Zecora's warning the previous day when they saw her.

Applejack completes the first event, the  , in 17 seconds, but receives a five-second penalty for bumping into one of the barrels. Rainbow Dash brushes through flawlessly in 18 seconds, earning one point. In the Strength Test, Rainbow Dash bucks the hammer hard enough to hit the bell at the top, but Applejack kicks the hammer hard enough to break it and send the bell flying, earning her a point. She credits her prowess to ""years of applebuckin'."" and kicks the tree Dash is sitting underneath. Apples fall on Dash's head to the tune of  . The goal of the next test, the Bronco Buck, is to buck Spike off in the shortest amount of time; Rainbow Dash wins this round. In Calf Roping, the contestants must lasso Spike; Applejack easily does this as Rainbow Dash accidentally ties herself to a tree branch. In the next round, Rainbow Dash beats Applejack at balancing and bouncing balls. Applejack brings the score back to 3-3 by shot-putting a bale of hay a further distance. Rainbow Dash wins the arm-wrestle, and Applejack bucks a football much further (4-4). Halfway through the competition, the ponies are tied 5-5, and most of   has joined the spectator stands.  Refusing to lose, Rainbow Dash starts winning more events by using her wings. She briefly flaps her wings to win a grueling push-up contest, propels herself forward in the Long Jump to gain a few more inches, and carries a flock of baby chicks on her outstretched wings in a race across some mud. In the last event, a game of  , Rainbow Dash flies up and tricks Applejack into talking and thus letting go of the rope. Applejack falls into the mud pit. With a staggering 15-5, Rainbow Dash ""wins"" the competition. Applejack calls out her friend for cheating with her wings. Rainbow Dash brings up the fact that she never said   to use her wings, but Applejack responds that she shouldn't have to. The farm pony challenges her to the annual Running of the Leaves, under the condition that she does not use her wings at all. Rainbow Dash accepts the terms.   After Applejack and Rainbow Dash agree to race in the Running of the Leaves, the scene cuts to black and fades to Twilight and Spike walking to the race. Spike mentions he wants to be the race's announcer, but the frame pans to Pinkie Pie in the  , who has already taken the role of announcer. She explains that the competition is one of Ponyville's traditions and its purpose is to shake the autumn leaves off the trees with the pounding of footsteps.    Several numbered competitors feature in the episode:   Pinkie Pie invites Spike to join her in commentating. As the racers gather at the starting line, Applejack makes sure Rainbow Dash will keep good on her promise by tying her wings up. To their surprise, Twilight Sparkle joins the race to experience it herself, giving them the opportunity to mock their ""egghead"" friend. They are deeply amused by the fact that she has never ran a race but has   on the subject.    The marathon begins and Rainbow Dash and Applejack are already leading, determined to win once and for all. They are neck and neck before Applejack trips over a rock. She immediately accuses her rival of intentionally tripping her. With the exception of Twilight Sparkle, who is casually strolling behind and enjoying the scenery, the rest of the ponies rush past her. Twilight informs her that she didn't look where she was going, and Applejack dashes off to make up for lost time. Later, Rainbow Dash slows to a comfortable trot, confident of her lead, but Applejack runs past her. This time, the Pegasus trips over a stump and falls second-to-last next to Twilight Sparkle. She reminds Rainbow Dash that this is just a game. Too stubborn to believe that her apple-bucking friend would never stoop to such acts, Rainbow Dash decides to play dirty. Pinkie Pie and Spike still narrate from above. Catching up to Applejack, the two use the environment of the   to their advantage, from branches to bees to tree syrup. Along the way, Rainbow Dash flips an arrow sign, which points Applejack to a dead-end up a nearby mountain. All the racers after Applejack continue on the original path and run past Rainbow Dash while she leans on the sign laughing. When Twilight stops by, she mentions that all the other racers just ran past her. Dash runs off to get back in the race. Meanwhile, Applejack reaches the mountain summit and realizes Dash tricked her. Pinkie Pie offers her a lift in the Twinkling Balloon.   As they approach the home stretch, Applejack and Rainbow fight harder than ever before to finish first. When the finish line is in sight, they start deliberately bumping into each other sideways. In the resulting tussle, Applejack accidentally unties Rainbow Dash's ropes, allowing her to break her promise at the last second and fly. Applejack intercepts her and they fight all the way to the finishing line. They start arguing about who finished first, but to their shock, their constant clash and mutual obstruction had caused them to fall behind and tie for last place. Even Twilight got fifth place, and she explains that she followed the advice from her books and paced herself throughout the race, before going all-out when most of the racers were worn out. Twilight says this is a good result for a first-time racer.  As Rainbow Dash and Applejack feel sorry for their own embarrassingly poor sportsmanship,   steps forward. The Princess was watching the entire event as fall is one of her favorite seasons. She forgives them, saying that   can get swept up in the competitive spirit. She points out that the two missed some of the leaf-laden trees. Realizing that friendship is more important than any competition, the two last-place racers run off together to finish off the rest of the trees.      "

Rarity exclaims ""I-de-a!"" in a sing-song voice and offers to make Dash,  , and   dresses for the Gala too, and they decide to hold a fashion show with their new dresses. Applejack questions whether Rarity can handle the workload, but Rarity laughs at the idea. The scene cross-fades to the song  , during which Rarity makes her friends' dresses.    After the song, Rarity leads her friends into the boutique with eyes closed, then shows them their new outfits. She proudly describes how each dress matches the pony it's for, and asks, ""Aren't they all amazing?"" The ponies stand awkwardly in silence, then struggle for words; Applejack says. ""They sure are... sumth'n"", Twilight agrees ""Yes! Something."", Pinkie Pie says ""I love something. Something is my favorite"" with an awkward smile, and Fluttershy sadly says ""It's... nice."" Rarity presses the ponies for their honest opinion, and they all agree that the dresses aren't what they had in mind. Rarity overcomes the disparaging reception and resolves to redo the dresses, wanting her friends to think they're absolutely perfect. After the ponies leave, Rarity wonders aloud, ""What have I gotten myself into?""   Fluttershy enters the boutique and Rarity shows her her   new gown. The scene cross-fades to Fluttershy in front of a mirror wearing the dress, and she tries to placate Rarity by saying she loves it, but Rarity doesn't buy it and pressures Fluttershy into telling her what she really thinks. Fluttershy goes off into a stream of intricate complaints about the sewing and the fabric, which leaves Rarity with her jaw dropped. The scene cross-fades into a reprise of  , where each pony gives their input about the dress Rarity sews them and Rarity gets increasingly frustrated and exhausted. Twilight requests technically accurate constellations; Pinkie Pie requests lollipops, balloons, candy, and streamers; Fluttershy requests French haute couture; Applejack requests galoshes; and Rainbow Dash gives the vague request ""it needs to be about 20% cooler."" At the song's conclusion, Rarity tells Opal that these are the ugliest dresses she's ever made. To make matters worse, she has no time left to make her own dress.   Rarity presents the dresses to her friends, and they all happily proclaim they're exactly what they asked for. Spike arrives at the door, panting, and excitedly reports that he happened to mention Rarity's fashion show to  , which Twilight identifies as ""the bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot"", and that Hoity Toity is coming to   from Canterlot to see Rarity's work. Rarity shrinks in horror at the thought that Hoity Toity will see the dresses her friends helped design.   At the fashion show, Rarity peeks from behind the curtain and spots Hoity Toity. She breathes heavily and tells herself to relax, certain that Hoity Toity will like the outfits. She shrieks in panic when the lights dim, before realizing it means the show is starting. The show soon starts, and the DJ,  , puts on a record as   emcees. He announces the ""breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!"" The ponies step onto the catwalk in their dresses and come to stand on a rotating platform. The crowd responds negatively, and Rarity's friends realize they overdid the dresses' designs. Hoity Toity declares the dresses ""amateurish,"" ""a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink,"" ""the ugliest things [he's] ever seen,"" and other disparaging remarks. Spike, still excited for Rarity, asks her to come out and take a bow. She walks out with her eyes lowered, and the scene fades to the whispers of the crowd and the awkward smiles of Rarity's friends on stage.  The next scene begins with Rarity's friends at her door. Pinkie Pie knocks and asks Rarity if she's okay, mentioning that she hasn't come out in days. Rarity goes on a dramatic monologue:   Twilight tries to coax her out, but she replies, ""Leave me alone! I want to be alone!"" The ponies try to figure out what to do, and Twilight spies Rarity's unfinished dress through the keyhole. The scene fades to Rarity in her room in front of a mirror in a robe and slippers, contemplating leaving to live in exile. Rarity's contemplations are interrupted by Opal's mewling. She searches for the origin of the noise out the window, and sees Opal distressed and shivering, stuck on a tree branch. Rarity runs outside to rescue her and finds Rainbow Dash next to Opal, chiding her for stranding Opal on the tree. Dash points her attention to the dress that Rarity's friends finished for her, ""thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing"", according to Applejack. When asked for her opinion on the dress, Rarity says she doesn't like it—she  . The ponies apologize for rejecting Rarity's original designs. Rarity forgives them but continues to wail about her ruined career. Fortunately, Hoity Toity agrees to attend a revised fashion show at Rarity's boutique.

The title of the episode is a play on the phrase ""feeling peachy keen,"" which refers to one feeling upbeat and generally happy.   The episode's premise stemmed from the common occurrence of having   when the weather is about to change, and Twilight's skepticism towards the phenomenon. The episode was #8 in the We Heart Ponies Fan Favorite Mare-a-thon, in the leadup to  .  was present in the episode prior to becoming popular with the  , and the show's director,  , called for a revision of the shot so that Derpy's eyes would be crossed.

The episode begins with   practicing magic spells on  . Spike notices   sneaking from cover to cover, wearing an umbrella hat and looking up at the sky. Twilight dismisses it as Pinkie Pie being herself, but then approaches her and asks what she's up to. Pinkie explains that her tail is twitching, which means her "" "" is telling her that ""stuff's gonna start falling!"" Twilight dismisses this but a frog falls on her face mid-sentence.  is flying above Pinkie and Twilight carrying a basket, a bag, and a cart, all loaded with goofy-looking frogs. She apologizes to Twilight and explains that she's moving the frogs from the pond to  , and then carries on her way.   When Pinkie Pie tells Twilight she has something on her face (a frog), Twilight sarcastically asks if Pinkie's Pinkie Sense told her that. Twilight and Spike go on their way and talk about Pinkie's prediction, which Twilight dismisses as a coincidence. Pinkie catches up to them and warns them that her tail is twitching and something else is going to fall. Twilight dismisses this and again gets cut mid-sentence, this time falling into a ditch. Spike asks Pinkie if it's safe to go help Twilight, and she confirms since her tail stopped twitching.   arrives and asks Twilight what she's doing in the ditch, and Spike replies that Pinkie predicted it. Twilight again dismisses the events as a coincidence. When Applejack hears Twilight mention ""twitchy tail"" she goes for cover, but Spike tells her it's safe since the prediction already came true. Applejack explains to Twilight that ""those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's-a-twichin', you better listen."" Pinkie Pie rushes back and warns them that her ears are flopping and that she'll start a bath for Twilight. Twilight, again, dismisses the prediction, but gets caked in mud from a hay cart passing through a puddle behind her.   The scene fades to Pinkie's bathroom in her apartment above  . She explains to Twilight, who's having a bath, that her Pinkie Sense involves ""different, little, niggly feelings [meaning] different things. [...] When my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen [...] my shoulder's achy, that means there's an alligator in the tub!"" Twilight jumps out of the tub in fright and asks Pinkie why her knee didn't get pinchy. Pinkie explains that it's not scary because it's her pet alligator named   who's got no teeth, while Gummy gums at her mane and tail. The scene fades to Twilight and Pinkie walking away from Sugarcube Corner. Twilight says she still doesn't believe this ""mumbo-jumbo."" Pinkie Pie asks ""What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?"" Twilight's jaw drops, and she exclaims that the difference is huge. She literally climbs onto a soapbox and explains that magic only happens when you decide it to happen, and that Pinkie's sense makes no sense at all. The two reach  , and Pinkie Pie tells Twilight that different combinations of her reactions also predict the future, for example ""ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter."" means the sky will be graced with a beautiful rainbow. Pinkie then experiences ""ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch,"" and Twilight gets squashed by Spike slamming the library door open. Spike backs up out of the library with an armload of books, accompanied by a sound effect of a truck backing up. Twilight, still recuperating, tells Pinkie that she said the combo meant ""beautiful rainbow,"" and Pinkie corrects her about the order of the twitches, which in this case meant ""look out for opening doors."" Pinkie tells Twilight she doesn't   because she doesn't  . Twilight hums and rubs her chin with a thoughtful expression on her face.   The scene cross-fades to the library basement where Pinkie Pie is hooked up to some sort of measuring instrument, a helmet with blinking lights strapped on her head, and her forelegs secured by metallic clasps. Twilight says that when she'll get another twitch, they'll have ""all kinds of scientific information."" They wait for a twitch, but Pinkie says they just come and go, which Twilight says makes no sense. Pinkie affirms that ""sometimes you just have to believe in things,"" but Twilight protests and asserts she will not believe in anything she cannot explain. Twilight angrily gives up, and Pinkie slips out of her helmet and restraints. On their way out of the basement Pinkie gets an ear flop, eye flutter, and knee-twitch, then Twilight again gets smashed behind a door that Spike opens. Still stuck to the back of the door, she asks Spike if he and Pinkie planned this prediction. She asserts that ""this can't be happening. This makes no sense"" and that she has to figure it out.   In a brief scene, Fluttershy reaches Froggy Bottom Bog with the frogs. The scene wipes to Pinkie Pie skipping about, with Twilight spying on her using a bush as concealment. Twilight wears a pith helmet and uses binoculars to observe Pinkie's actions. Spike walks up to Twilight and accidentally startles her, and she explains to him that she's observing Pinkie, ""scientific name: Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat,"" and expresses her mistrust in Pinkie's Pinkie Sense. At the school playground, she sees her scratching her nose before rushing to find a place to hide ""like something's about to fall from the sky."" Twilight says this makes no sense because a twitchy tail indicates something would fall. Before she finishes dictating her conclusion to Spike, a swarm of bees appears and attacks her. Next, outside Applejack's barn, she sees another ear-flop eye-flutter knee-twitch combo. Spike identifies it as the combo for opening doors, and Twilight scoffs her belief in the prediction, and again suffers mid-sentence when she falls into a cellar door that had just opened.  The scene fades to Twilight in leg casts sitting in a wheelchair, still observing Pinkie Pie with her binoculars. She reports ""twitchy tail"" to  , who panics and runs away. Twilight again dismisses the prediction and tells Spike he's overreacting, but before she can finish her sentence a series of classic cartoon props drop on her head: a flower pot, an anvil, a cart of hay and finally a piano. The frame moves up to reveal that the items were dropped by   and  , who are hovering next to a movers' truck. Twilight later confronts Pinkie Pie and finds she was aware of her presence the whole time. Suddenly, Pinkie's   body begins shaking. Spike asks what this means, but Pinkie answers that she doesn't know and she's never gotten it before, but that whatever it is, it's a ""doozy,"" something completely unexpected, and that it's going to happen at Froggy Bottom Bog. Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Spike rush to the bog to make sure Fluttershy, who was headed there earlier, is okay. Twilight dismisses the prediction yet again, but tags along anyway because she wants to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when they find out nothing's wrong. The scene wipes to Fluttershy at Froggy Bottom Bog with ominous music and an unidentified creature moving in the waters behind Fluttershy while she sets the frogs loose.    Pinkie keeps getting her twitches and Twilight makes sarcastic remarks towards her. Spike thinks up of bad things that could happen to Fluttershy, but Twilight assures him that she's fine. They reach the bog and soon find Fluttershy safe and sound. Twilight gloats about how right she was that there was no ""doozy"" and goes on about how there's no point in believing anything you can't see for yourself. Without her noticing, a huge creature creeps around the ponies, and Spike calls Twilight's attention to it. She looks behind her at a gigantic four-headed   which growls and roars.  The ponies and Spike run and the hydra pursues them. Twice Twilight goes back, to pull Pinkie Pie along and to rescue Spike from sinking in the bog. They run up a hill but get trapped at the edge of a cliff, with stepping-stone pillars leading to the other side. Fluttershy is the first pony to cross the chasm. Despite being a Pegasus she doesn't fly, however she recites to herself ""a hop, skip, and a jump"" from the song Pinkie Pie taught her in  . Pinkie Pie has a Pinkie Sense episode and shakes herself over the edge of the cliff, though she hangs in mid-air and gets pulled back by Applejack, who carries her across by the tail. Twilight decides to charge at the hydra head-on, or in this case right under it. Before she has a chance to cross herself, the hydra lunges at her but misses, driving one of its heads into the edge of the cliff and knocking over one of the stepping-stone pillars, which in turn knocks the next one and the next, so only two are left. Pinkie Pie tries to convince Twilight to ""take a leap of faith."" The hydra lunges again and breaks off the ground Twilight was standing on. Twilight jumps but misses the pillar, and lands on a bog bubble that bounces her across the chasm and over to her friends.    Just as Twilight congratulates Pinkie for predicting the doozy, Pinkie has another spell of shudders, and she tells Twilight that the hydra wasn't the doozy. When Twilight hears the hydra wasn't the doozy, Twilight literally bursts into flames in anger. She says she gives up, and that she's willing to believe the Pinkie Sense is true even though she doesn't understand it. Pinkie goes through some strange twitches which suddenly stop, and she tells Twilight that   was the doozy, Twilight's willingness to believe.   Wearing an umbrella hat with Pinkie Pie, Twilight gives Spike a   for  . As the episode ends, Pinkie's tail twitches once more, and Spike takes Twilight's report out to the balcony.

Fluttershy is relieved that it's quiet but notices that it's   quiet. She goes to check on the fillies and discovers that they're gone. Looking into the henhouse, she also notices that one of the chickens named   is gone too. Seeing hoofprints leading into the Everfree Forest, Fluttershy hesitantly ventures into the forest to find them. While the Crusaders argue amongst themselves, Fluttershy finds Twilight, only to discover that she's been turned to stone. Realizing what this means, she rushes to find the fillies.   Fluttershy finds the Cutie Mark Crusaders looking for the missing Elizabeak. She tells them that a  , a creature with the head of a chicken and a body of a snake, is on the loose, and warns them not to look one in the eyes. However, they laugh at the silly description before seeing the chicken pass them by. They notice a second chicken hiding in the bushes, one with a long reptilian body: the cockatrice. Its stare causes Elizabeak to turn to stone. The Crusaders panic at the sight of this, and Fluttershy tells them to stand behind her. When she sees how scared the fillies are, Fluttershy confronts the cockatrice face-to-face. She counters the cockatrice's gaze with her own intimidating stare, ordering it to change Elizabeak and Twilight back to normal. As the cockatrice runs away, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, impressed by their babysitter's ability, dub her the ""Stare Master."" With Twilight and Elizabeak free from the creature's spell, they all return home.  Back at the cottage the next morning, Fluttershy explains to Twilight the events that happened, inspiring her to write another   to  . Fluttershy learns one shouldn't do a task that is more than can be handled. Rarity then returns, surprised at how well her sister and her friends behave. She tries to get the Crusaders to collect their things to no avail. Fluttershy, however, gets their attention easily, and the Crusaders run inside to get their bags. An impressed Rarity then asks Fluttershy to help her with a new problem with her cat Opal, who is clinging tightly to her body.

The title of this episode may be literally referencing the Cutie Mark Crusaders' antics, in which they perform a theatrical showstopper - a performance that garners enthusiastic or prolonged applause, which usually forces the performers to stop the performance until it has died down.

Twilight asks what's going on, to which Apple Bloom replies, ""Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians."" Twilight tells them that they're trying to get their cutie marks the wrong way, and suggests they do things in areas they already like. Cheerilee shows them a flier for a talent show that will be taking place the next day. With so many possibilities to find their talents, the fillies start to plan their show, each making bizarre or dangerous suggestions. Twilight again urges them to do something they're   good at. The girls say they can do that, then go around town collecting and borrowing random items. Inside the clubhouse, the Crusaders come up with a plan for the show: a spectacular musical number. Apple Bloom suggests Sweetie Belle as the singer, but Sweetie Belle is afraid to sing in front of a crowd and says she would rather be like her sister, Rarity, and design the scenery. Despite Scootaloo's agility, she decides to sing instead of doing the choreography, thus leaving the job to Apple Bloom, though the closest thing she knows is Kung Fu. They all fail miserably while practicing but help each other out in the process. While they're finishing their preparations, Applejack comes to check on them. She sees their act is terrible and hesitates when they ask her opinion. Thinking she's impressed, they feel ready to wow the crowd.    The show begins with   and   trying to pull off a magic trick, and then   doing a poem on roller skates.

The   starts off smoothly, but soon Scootaloo begins singing off-key, Apple Bloom starts accidentally dancing into scenery, and Sweetie Belle struggles to maintain the backdrops and effects. In the end, the entire act literally falls on top of them, and the audience laughs. They slink backstage, wondering if they were really ""that bad."" Cheerilee meets them and tells them to go back onstage for the awards, but they're too embarrassed. She tells them to be good sports, so they return with her while trying to hide behind the other performers. To their surprise, they win the award for best comedy act, which immediately perks them up until they find out they still haven't gotten their cutie marks. After the show, Twilight congratulates them for a job well done and asks them if they learned anything, saying she could make a special  . As she asks them questions, they seem to understand their mistakes, eventually reaching the conclusion that their true talent is comedy instead. Applejack, Rarity and   come backstage, and the Cutie Mark Crusaders run off to talk with them.

In this episode,   is searching for a new load of gems with  's assistance. However, when a group of   called the   abduct Rarity, Spike and the other ponies head into the Dogs' underground burrows to rescue her.   The phrase ""a dog and pony show"" originated in 19th century America as a term for small traveling circuses that toured through rural areas. The modern usage refers to an over-staged performance. Typically, the term is used to connote disdain, jocular lack of appreciation, or distrust of the message being presented or the efforts undertaken to present it. The episode's plot is reminiscent of the   story   in which a young boy's antics drive his kidnappers so crazy that they end up paying his family to take him back. In the iTunes release of the episode, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy are missing when the group arrives at the bottom of the hole. Another iTunes exclusive error, albeit minor, is the inconsistency of the appearance of Twilight Sparkle's rope harness: For example, in one scene, when Twilight Sparkle bucked off the Diamond Dog guard riding her, the guard haphazardly pulled off the harness with his claws as he was flung away. In other releases of the episode, Twilight Sparkle's harness remained around her head rather than being pulled off. The show's director,  , explained that iTunes somehow got an older version of the episode that was not meant for air. The error with Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy missing is also present in some international airings and in the Netflix version of this episode, as well as the Australian MLP Volume 4 DVD. It also remained unfixed in the iTunes 1080p version of the episode.     Inside the  , as   is putting the last   onto a garment, she hears a customer walk into her shop. She casually greets the customer, only to find out in shock that it's ""Pony of Pop"" sensation  . Sapphire explains that she had heard of Rarity's fashion designs from a local magazine and came to browse the shop for designs for an upcoming tour. Rarity happily shows Sapphire her latest finished project: a garment completely covered in gems. Sapphire takes an immediate liking to the bejeweled garment, saying that she will buy it and five more like it, each one featuring a different jewel. Having used her   gem supply for just the one outfit, Rarity faints.  With assistance from  , Rarity goes to find a new load of gems outside  . When they first uncover some, Spike can barely contain his hunger, but Rarity reminds him that they need to collect the gems for Sapphire Shores' outfits. Spike manages to curb his appetite, and in the end Rarity rewards him with a blue gem. Rather than eat it right away, he decides to keep it as a gift from his crush.   Hiding in the bushes is a trio of canines who call themselves the  . They are in awe of the large haul of jewels being carted along by the baby dragon, mistaking him as a gem tracker. They then hear Rarity's voice and discover that   is the one finding the gems. Ambushed by the mutts, Rarity panics, but Spike intercepts them so Rarity can escape. However, they shake him off and succeed in abducting Rarity before escaping into their hole in the ground.   After explaining the situation to  ,  ,  ,  , and  , Spike brings them to the spot of the incident only to see the entire site laden with holes. They encounter the dogs but are outmaneuvered to exhaustion when the dogs refill the holes and then pop out of them to trip the ponies up. As the ponies worry about Rarity and how frightened she must be, Spike uses his blue gem as bait to catch one of the dogs with a fishing rod. The scene dissolves into a fantasy sequence where Spike imagines himself as a debonair knight coming to Rarity's rescue. His fishing line is snagged, and he and the ponies are dragged through a large underground tunnel that gives way to a whole network of tunnels. They theorize that the dogs had taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems, but there is no way to find her until Spike reminds Twilight that Rarity showed her how to track gems herself. Using the spell, Twilight locates the tunnel with the most gems.    Within the central area of the Diamond Dogs' den, the dogs demand Rarity find gems for them. She graciously finds them some gems and then asks to be let go, but the dogs order her to dig for the gems. She does so but very slowly and inefficiently. Frustrated at this pathetically slow pace, the leader calls on his comrades to do the digging. Rarity proceeds to make things exceedingly difficult for the dogs, complaining about her situation and even getting them to do all the work. But the dogs soon decide to endure Rarity's constant whining as long as she does as she's told. However, after one of the dogs calls her a mule, Rarity breaks down in tears. In a nearby tunnel, Spike and the ponies hear Rarity's cries and rush to help her. A group of guard dogs sees them as new ""workhorses"" and ambushes them. Following Applejack's lead, the ponies buck the dogs off rodeo-style, and the guard dogs retreat. After they get rid of the guards, Spike hops on Twilight, brandishing a lance-like stalactite, and the six friends gallop to Rarity's rescue. They find Rarity after she's already cowed the Diamond Dogs into submission. The dogs, tired of Rarity's whining, offer to give away all of the gems they found, providing the ponies take Rarity with them.   On their way home, Rarity reveals that annoying her captors was all a ruse to keep them under control. Twilight sees this as a valuable   to write   about: just because someone is ladylike doesn't mean they're helpless.      "

Fluttershy arrives a minute later and is frustrated about being unable to meet Rarity. She tells Twilight that she dislikes being a model but continues because of Rarity's support. Twilight is about to tell her Rarity's secret when Pinkie appears and reminds Twilight of the price of breaking secrets. Twilight suggests that Fluttershy act the exact opposite of what Photo Finish wants: clumsy and unattractive. Twilight will use her magic to sabotage the next fashion show and cause Fluttershy to be fired. She discusses her plan with Pinkie and swears her to secrecy.    During the next fashion show, Twilight uses her magic to manipulate Fluttershy into barking, baying, tripping, falling, and picking her nose. Photo Finish is dismayed with the performance.

"Over a Barrel","Dave Polsky","2011-03-25","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Over_a_Barrel"," is the twenty-first   of the first season of  . The idiom ""over a barrel"" means being in a helpless position where others are in control. In this episode, the   and   separate and are caught in a dispute between  's settler-ponies and the native buffalo herd.   The crew worked with a Native Consultant and did revisions to the episode according to his notes. The episode's closed-captions misspell   as ""Appaloosa"".    The episode begins with   and her friends on a train to the recently-built western town of  , where   plans to replant one of her trees - named   - in her relatives' orchard. Everyone is looking forward to Appleloosa, but during the journey,   and   show varying amounts of discomfort: Rarity doesn't like the fact that Applejack's tree was placed in a private cart in the rear, forcing her to bunk with her friends, and Spike is tired from cooking snacks with his fire breath. When   complains that not all of her popcorn kernels were popped, Spike burns her popcorn black and goes to bed. Rainbow Dash asks   if they're going to carry the tree all the way to the apple orchard. Pinkie Pie, wondering if she refers to Bloomberg, is met with a sarcastic response from Rainbow Dash saying they would actually be carrying  . Failing to get the joke, Pinkie tells Rainbow Dash that Fluttershy is not a tree. This leads to a rather confusing conversation with Twilight, but in the end, Fluttershy is awake as well, saying that she would   to be a tree. Spike, frustrated with his inability to fall asleep, makes his way to the private cart to bunk with Bloomberg. Fluttershy jokingly calls Spike ""Huffy the magic dragon,"" and the four friends laugh. Rarity, frustrated herself, demands they be quiet, and all of them go to sleep.   The next morning, the ponies are awoken by a herd of stampeding buffalo charging next to the train. The buffalo start ramming into the side of the train in an ambush attack. Due to lack of sleep the previous night, Spike sleeps through the attack. A younger, leaner buffalo leaps onto the train and, after outmaneuvering Rainbow Dash, disconnects the caboose from the other train cars. The buffalo then push the disconnected caboose down the line in the opposite direction, with Bloomberg and Spike still inside.  Upon arriving at Appleloosa, Applejack rushes out to tell her cousin  , who had been waiting excitedly at the station for their arrival, that they have a problem. Unfortunately, Braeburn insists on giving his cousin and her friends a tour around the new town. Finally, after going as far as showing the group the new apple orchard, Applejack finally gets Braeburn's attention. She tells him what had happened to the train before their arrival, and Braeburn sadly says that he's aware of the whole situation, stating that the buffalo are demanding for them to remove the trees, but they argue that they can't, otherwise the town wouldn't be able to survive in the desert.    Coincidentally, Pinkie has the same idea as Rainbow Dash to find and rescue Spike by getting to the buffalo herd, but the herd manages to get to them first. Just before a fight breaks out, Spike arrives and breaks it up, using his new respect that he has somehow earned from the buffalo. Pinkie and Rainbow Dash are brought to the buffalo tribe's camp, where Dash meets the young female buffalo   again, and are told that because Appleloosan townsponies have planted the orchard, they can no longer travel along their traditional stampeding grounds. She explains that the theft of Bloomberg was to send a message.   then arrives, confirms Little Strongheart's explanation, and says that the land the Appleloosans now inhabit was stampeded upon by many generations of buffalo. Rainbow Dash feels sympathetic toward the herd of buffalo, and makes sure to talk to the townsponies about it. Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash return to Appleloosa with Little Strongheart just as Twilight, the rest of her friends, and Braeburn are about to set out in search of them. Rainbow Dash urges Little Strongheart to tell them why the Appleloosans should move the trees, while Applejack urges Braeburn to tell Little Strongheart why the trees should stay. Both Braeburn and Little Strongheart are made very uncomfortable by the situation and being forced to speak, and end up not saying anything to each other. Instead, Applejack and Rainbow Dash begin arguing about it. Before long, Twilight intervenes and says that both sides have good reasons to keep the land.    Pinkie Pie tries to send out a message about sharing by putting on  , as both Appleloosans and buffalo watch. Pinkie tries to encourage them to share by singing about the similarities between the ponies and buffalo. Unfortunately, Thunderhooves and the town's sheriff   are not impressed. The only thing they could agree on is that Pinkie's performance was the worst they had ever seen. After declaring a time for action, the buffalo chief gives a clear ultimatum: the townsfolk must uproot all of the trees by high noon the next day, or the herd will be forced to destroy them, along with Appleloosa in the process. Silverstar, in response, simply states that the town will be waiting for them.    Twilight and the others try to talk both the Appleloosans and the buffalo out of the fight, but no one is listening. High noon the next day finally arrives, and the buffalo appear on a ridge overlooking the town. Strongheart softly gestures to the chief to back down, and it almost works, until Pinkie Pie appears, singing a reprise of her number from the day before in a last-ditch, last-minute, and horrendously ill-timed effort to stop the fight before it even begins. Thunderhooves, now enraged, signals the buffalo to go on the attack, using nothing more or less than their own brute strength. The townsponies fight back against the buffalo with an ample supply of apple pies, which are surprisingly effective at confusing and stopping the stampeding buffalo. Both groups manage to take out some of their opposition, also damaging the town in the process. The scene shifts to Silverstar making a final stand next to his saloon, and once he runs out of apple pies to throw, he takes off his hat in quiet submission, as Thunderhooves makes a mad charge at him. However, a stray apple pie hits Thunderhooves square in the face, disabling him. Lying on the ground momentarily, Thunderhooves licks the apple pie off of his face, and enthralled by its delicious taste, says they could come to an agreement.   The Appleloosan ponies are allowed to keep the land, and in return, the Appleloosans would share its fruit (or more specifically, its apple pies) with the buffalo herd during their stampeding. The townsponies, meanwhile, create a road through the orchard so the herd can continue their stampeding tradition. Both parties find this to be agreeable and the dispute has come to an end. In addition, Applejack is finally able to plant Bloomberg. Twilight learns that with compromise and understanding, to share and to care, sometimes the worst of enemies can become the best of friends.      "

Twilight's friends' mannerisms during the brunch do nothing to quell her anxiety.   make sure the princess has plenty of tea to drink; the Princess thanks them for each refill, but grows awkward due to the constant hospitality. She decides to have a little fun with them by pretending to sip from her cup, making them overfill it. While Celestia speaks to Fluttershy about what Twilight told her from her letters, she's distracted by her pet bird  , whose condition appears to be less than well; however, before Celestia can stay long, one of the Princess' royal guards informs her about her engagement with the Mayor, and she is forced to leave. Everyone is relieved. However, Celestia leaves her pet in the shop and Fluttershy, believing it to be sick, decides to take it into her   for treatment.    Oddly enough, Philomena appears to be a very difficult patient to Fluttershy. She tries everything she can think of, including taking her temperature, attempting to make her ingest a medicine tablet, making tomato soup, and even having her and a former patient of hers,  , sing together to her. Her condition does not improve, and she ends up coughing mouse food in Fluttershy's face. At this point, she's convinced Philomena has a ""tickle"" in her throat, and sets up a humidifier to clear it. It is not, however, effective as evidenced by another cough despite her therapy. Fluttershy refuses to give up, however, and tries some more remedies (aroma therapy, warm bath, and ointment); none of them work. By this time, Philomena appears to be even sicker. As a last resort, Fluttershy decides to attach the feathers that had fallen off with surgical tape; predictably, it fails to work. Just as she is about to give up, there's a knock at the door from Twilight Sparkle. She's here to thank Fluttershy for making a good impression, but is shocked after she sees Philomena in the house. While she sympathizes with Fluttershy's good intentions, she insists that she still had taken the bird without Celestia's permission, and Twilight believes that the consequences will be dire. Against her better judgment, Fluttershy and Twilight agree, and put Philomena in a basket so she can be returned to her cage.   Just as they reach the exit of the house, Celestia's guards arrive to relay the news about the missing bird. She and Fluttershy attempt to lie their way out of the situation, and wish the guards luck on their search. Despite the fact that the lie includes fake coughing and claims of day air being drier than night air, it works well enough for them to leave quickly. It's clear that they cannot simply return Philomena at this point (Twilight believes that Fluttershy     or banished and then put in a dungeon in the place that she is banished), so they decide not to risk it. Fluttershy still hopes that she can cure Philomena. However, she lacks the assertiveness to cure her, so Twilight offers to help by giving ""tough love,"" using much more abrasive techniques than Fluttershy did. Just as Twilight is about to force-feed some soup to Philomena, she escapes through the door, though the door-frame on Philomena's cage is actually no larger or smaller than the other viewing holes on the cage.    The ponies pursue the bird in a chase scene around Ponyville, trying to catch her while avoiding the guards. Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy find their other friends, but they're confused as to why they're scattered all over the place, lifting them up and down. They finally discover Philomena on top of the town's fountain statue; she has lost all her feathers and appears to be dying. She then falls off the statue rather dramatically. Fluttershy rushes over in an attempt to catch her, but can only watch in sheer horror as she spontaneously reduces herself to ash.    Just as the animal-loving Pegasus begins to cry, Princess Celestia arrives to discover the commotion; Twilight, believing her mentor will go easier on her, tries to cover for her, but Fluttershy insists that   should come clean and tell the truth instead, even at the risk of punishment from Equestria's ruler. The princess tells the pile of ash to ""stop fooling around,"" to which it responds by materializing into a majestic red-and-orange bird. She explains that what appeared to be sickly molting was actually just another part of a phoenix's life cycle. Apparently, Philomena took advantage of this as an opportunity for mischief and is told to apologize. Fluttershy receives no punishment, but Celestia reminds her that everything could have been avoided if she just asked to take care of Philomena. Fluttershy apologizes for the entire ordeal. Twilight realizes that this situation is a lesson about asking before taking matters into your own hooves, and asks if the Princess would like a  , but Celestia declines. Later, Rainbow Dash gets Philomena to tickle the royal guards on their noses with a feather as a prank, and when it is successful, she gives Rainbow Dash a high five, whilst Celestia, the royal guards, and the Mane Six laugh with them.

The high-class ponies have no idea what a rooster is. Dinner is served, postponing Applejack's embarrassment, but there are only a few disappointing morsels on the plate. As she watches the sun rise the next morning, she says out loud how much she misses her family and the apple orchards. Just then, she hears a loud bang and sees a beautiful rainbow stretch across the sky towards home. She realizes that she truly belongs at home on the farm. Gladly returning to the farm and greeting her grandma and brother, her   springs into existence: a trio of red apples. After Applejack runs off to continue pursuing the rabbits, Scootaloo presses the group onwards.   The crusaders narrowly avoid colliding with Fluttershy, who is guiding ducklings across a road. She tells them that they should be more careful, and asks them why they are in such a hurry. When they tell her that they're on their way to get Rainbow Dash's cutie mark story, Fluttershy says that she owes her cutie mark to Dash.   Fluttershy recalls that when she was little, she was very shy and the weakest flier in her summer flight camp. After failing at an attempt to fly through some cloud rings,   start making fun of her. Fluttershy calls it ""the most humiliating moment of [her] life."" Suddenly, Rainbow Dash lands in between Fluttershy and the bullies, telling them to leave her alone. The bullies and Dash agree to a race to determine who's the ""big shot."" Fluttershy, standing on another cloud, waves a checkered flag to start the race. As they take off, Fluttershy is knocked off her cloud and into free fall. Unable to fly, she keeps falling until a dense swarm of butterflies gently carries her to the ground. She had never been near the ground before and so had never seen butterflies before, but she finds them and the surrounding meadows beautiful. She starts   to express her admiration of the little creatures and sights in this new world. At the end of her song, there is a loud bang in the sky, accompanied by an enormous expanding rainbow-colored ring. The bang frightens the animals, and they run for cover. Fluttershy kindly calms the quaking animals, discovering her innate ability to communicate with animals on a ""different level."" This earns her the cutie mark of three pink butterflies. Since Fluttershy did not witness the rest of the race, Scootaloo wants to find Dash. Sweetie Belle suggests that maybe Rarity knows. Somehow, they end up being Rarity's assistants. Hearing of their ongoing pursuit of their cutie marks, she recalls the time she got hers.    Rarity says that when she was a filly, she was put in charge of costumes during a school play. The day before the performance, her teacher calls them ""very nice,"" but they aren't good enough for Rarity; they need to be spectacular. In her workroom, Rarity tries every trick she knows, but the costumes won't work. She wonders if her dream of being a fashion designer is dissolving before her very eyes. Her horn begins to glow brightly and drags her to a desolate, rocky area, right into a large boulder. She is less than pleased at the possibility that a rock might have to do with her destiny and yells at her horn. She is interrupted by an explosive rainbow ring, exactly like the one that Fluttershy witnessed. The shock waves split the boulder, revealing a cavity filled with multicolored  . On the night of the performance, the dancers wear dazzling gem-studded dresses. Rarity's inspiration, not to mention her new ability to track hidden gems, gives her a cutie mark of three blue diamonds. Scootaloo pushes her friends out of the shop, tired of Rarity's ""namby-pamby"" story. She hopes to find Dash and hear a more exciting tale. They encounter Twilight, however, and they end up listening to hers.    Even as a filly, Twilight has her knack for magic. After witnessing   raise the sun with magic at the  , Twilight is inspired to extensively study magic. She is seen in her bedroom with a pile of books, performing magic for the first time when she is able to magically turn the pages of her book. Her parents enroll her into Celestia's  . The entrance exam is to hatch a dragon's egg using magic. Under the scrutiny of the judges, she is too stressed to cast a successful spell. Just as she gives up and apologizes for wasting the testers' time, she hears an ear-shattering boom outside. Inexplicably, it triggers her magic and she directs her beam of magic towards the egg. The egg hatches, revealing baby  . However, she immediately loses control, causing her eyes to glow white. Magic and lightning fills the whole room, levitating judges, turning her parents into potted plants, and making Spike gigantic. Outside, Princess Celestia sees Spike's head bursting through the tower roof. She places her hoof on Twilight and Twilight withdraws her magic and profusely apologizes. Celestia says that she has never seen a filly with such raw ability. She offers to take Twilight as her personal protégé to teach her how to control her magic. Twilight's parents eagerly encourage her to take the offer and Twilight is overjoyed. Celestia points out that a cutie mark, a violet-colored star with five small white stars surrounding it, just appeared on Twilight's flank.  has suggested that there is more to Princess Celestia than has been depicted of her in the series. She says, in relation to the events of the flashback, Celestia sensed that Twilight Sparkle is connected to the   and arranged the dragon-hatching test for her. Celestia then raised and trained Spike, and assigned him to be Twilight's assistant. The   leave a cheerfully-skipping Twilight, hopping on their cart to find Dash once again.    Pinkie Pie unexpectedly appears inside their wagon, complete with riding helmet. She offers to tell them how she earned her cutie mark if they join her in Sugarcube Corner, to which the fillies reluctantly agree. In a flashback, Pinkie is shown as a filly, living on a rock farm with her family outside of Ponyville. According to her, there is no talking and no smiling, just rocks. One day, after her family goes inside their barn without her, she hears an explosion from the sky and sees a rainbow ring. The blast of wind fluffs up her straight mane and tail. The rainbow arching across the sky gives the grey world around her color and she feels a joy that she had never felt before. She is so overwhelmed that she wants to ""smile forever"" and, even more so, wants to spread this happiness. The next day, as her family is heading out to move rocks from the south field, they hear muffled music from the silo, and Pinkie Pie beckons them inside. Her mother calls her by her full name: "" "" Inside, there are party decorations, balloons, streamers, music, and cake. At first, the family seems completely out of its element and surprised by this ""party."" Their expressionless faces start changing as their mouths wiggle...and they finally break into huge smiles. Pinkie exclaims, ""I'm so happy!"" as she dances with her family, and her cutie mark (blue and yellow balloons) appears. Back in the present, the Cutie Mark Crusaders and Pinkie reach Sugarcube Corner. Pinkie finishes her story by saying, ""And that was how Equestria was made!"" and says that she will tell them her cutie mark story on the way home. Sweetie Belle assures Scootaloo that that was just Pinkie ""being Pinkie."" The Cutie Mark Crusaders finally find Rainbow Dash, who is with her friends. Having heard of the fillies' interest in her cutie mark, Dash tells them her story.    Taking place where Fluttershy's story left off, Rainbow and the two bully Pegasi begin their race. They are to fly through the cloud rings toward the finish line. Rainbow Dash is already in the lead, and soon one of the bullies crashes into a cloud-pillar. Dash is bumped by the other bully and veers off course, but she catches up and takes the lead again. She tells the Cutie Mark Crusaders about how she found a love for the adrenaline and excitement of gaining so much speed. Her desire to win helps her beat the bullies and, most of all, perform the ultimate trick that was only told in legends: the  . She wins the race and obtains her mark: a rainbow colored lightning bolt. Rainbow Dash mentions in a previous episode,  , that she was the first in her class to get a cutie mark.   As the story ends, Dash's friends suddenly remember hearing, or seeing, that very blast from their stories. Eventually, an epiphany forms: Dash's race led to the inspiration of their goals and helped them earn their cutie marks. They believe that they were destined to be friends, even before they knew each other. They gather for a group hug, while Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle pull a reluctant Scootaloo into a group hug of their own. As Fluttershy suggests another song, Scootaloo cries out in despair. By the end of the day, Spike writes Twilight's latest   of how one's connection can lead to a future friendship, while sarcastically commenting about the letter's sappiness. She simply replies, ""Just write it, Spike.""   Before the episode premiered, visitors of Hubworld.com were presented with a   and a chance to vote on how they think Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark. The results had no effect on the episode; voters simply guessed which was accurate. There were three possibilities:   Many of the characters in the flashbacks share the same design or color scheme with ""modern-day"" show characters, and some of the incidental young ponies share the same design as the main characters' young versions. One of the fillies that young Rarity designs a costume for appears to be a young  . Two of the fillies wearing young Rarity's costumes share the same design of young Applejack and young Pinkie Pie, with different color schemes. Twilight Sparkle's mother shares ""modern-day"" Twilight's character design and the color scheme of original Twilight, from the first generation of  . The blackboard on the wall behind Twilight features the same diagram and the same equation as the blackboard in the episode  . Spike's egg isn't purple and green as claimed in   by Spike. The egg consists of two different colors of purple instead.  in her flashback is noticeably taller and more gangly than the other fillies of the main cast, and her wings fold like those of an adult Pegasus and not like those of a filly like Scootaloo or young Rainbow Dash. This is consistent with her saying that she is one year older than Pinkie Pie in  . The show's developer,  , suggested that Fluttershy might have gone through an ""awkward phase.""      "

On the way out, Twilight remembers that she owns a relevant book on astronomy and asks Spike to fetch it. When he picks it up, the dust makes him sneeze fire, accidentally burning the book pages. He hides the book to avoid telling Twilight about it and lies instead, saying that someone might have borrowed it. Twilight believes him and they, along with their friends, set up a picnic on a hill under a starry sky.   gives Spike a bow tie laden with jewels. The ponies enjoy the meteor shower and the food, but Spike falls asleep in the punch bowl.    Twilight Sparkle tucks Spike into bed and starts writing her findings on the meteor shower.

Spike tries to befriend Owlowiscious, but the latter only says, ""Hoo."" Spike suspects that this new assistant is ""after [his] job,"" and warns the owl that he will be keeping a close eye on it. Later that day while reading a book about owls, Spike overhears a conversation of Twilight's friends outside the library. Fluttershy is fascinated by the bird, and much to Spike's dismay, Rarity gives Owlowiscious another one of her bejeweled bow ties. Seeing him take off in a huff,   and   suspect Spike feels jealous, or even threatened, of the newcomer. Later, Spike tries to assist Twilight as usual, but Owlowiscious is always one step ahead of him. In one case, Spike asks around all over   to find a new quill pen, before finally managing to take a feather from a chicken. When he returns, he sees that Twilight already has a new quill: one of Owlowiscious' feathers. In a huff, Spike announces he will now do all the chores the owl hasn't finished yet, but falls asleep in exhaustion almost immediately.   He is woken up in the next scene: Owlowiscious has found the charred astronomy book, and Twilight is very upset that Spike lied to her. He storms out of the library, proclaiming that he intends to get even with the bird. While outside, he sees a mouse scurry away and remembers that owls eat mice. He leaves the scene, only to return in a villainous disguise. He sneaks into Rarity's boutique, takes  's toy mouse, and ventures back into the library, where he intends to make a mess using the now-destroyed toy, pillow feathers, and ketchup, hoping that the owl would get blamed.

Spike tries to reason with the dragon, citing their relation in species, but the dragon is not placated and attacks. Just as he is being cornered, Owlowiscious and Twilight arrive. With the owl's guidance, they rescue Spike and distract and outmaneuver the adult dragon before escaping into the forest. Twilight later explains that she was very worried when he disappeared, and that they followed the tracks Spike's ketchup-covered feet made. Twilight assures him that she only spent her time with Owlowiscious because he was awake during the night-time and because Spike is still too young to stay up late. Spike apologizes to the two for being so jealous, and Twilight apologizes in return for not being sensitive enough to Spike's feelings.

However, she sees that all the attention she is getting is far more strict and stern than she had anticipated, and she awkwardly becomes quiet. Rarity finally meets her dream pony, Prince Blueblood. After introducing herself, she finds a rose in the royal garden and points it out to him. Instead of offering it to Rarity, he places it on his own suit, claiming that it compliments his eyes. Meanwhile, in the gardens, Fluttershy quickly follows the melody, but it leads her to  , an elderly groundskeeper who simply loves to whistle while he works.

Rarity keeps her composure, hoping to see Blueblood's chivalrous side. Blueblood stops her from stepping into a water puddle. Despite her expectation that he lay his coat over the puddle for them to cross, he uses   scarf instead. As they reach the exit, she implies that Blueblood open it, but he turns his nose in the air and Rarity is forced to open it. In the garden, Fluttershy tries patience in the hope that the animals will come to her, but eventually she resorts to setting traps for them. Even   fails.   As the gala continues, Rarity and Blueblood approach Applejack's booth outside. Rarity orders two apple fritters. Disappointed once more when the Prince expects her to pay for the food, Applejack intervenes, giving them the fritters on the house. Upon tasting the fritter, Prince Blueblood quickly spits out the food after realizing that his royal tongue touched ""common carnival fare"" and returns to the party for food of his preferred tastes. Rarity scowls at Blueblood's denouncement of her friend's perfectly good wares.   Applejack realizes that everyone is eating   rather than her apple treats, and as an attempt to ""dress-up"" her fare, she decides to cart a cake into the ballroom and sell it there. Pinkie Pie, in her continuous attempts to add flair to the boring festivities, accidentally stage-dives into the cart and flings the cake into the air. The cake flies right towards Blueblood, who uses Rarity as a shield to keep himself from being hit by it. Rarity finally loses her temper and shakes off the cake pieces onto Blueblood. He retreats and accidentally bumps into the room's centerpiece statue, which begins toppling over. Rainbow Dash tries to use this opportunity to get noticed by The Wonderbolts and successfully catches the statue. Unfortunately, she can't balance it and it bumps into one of the ballroom's stone columns. It topples over and takes down the rest of the columns with it. When the dust settles, the centerpiece statue cracks and breaks. As Celestia and Twilight enter the ballroom and see the destruction, Twilight resignedly comments that things cannot get any worse. At that moment, a stampede of the royal gardens' animals bursts through the door with Fluttershy behind them, enraged and ordering the animals to love her. With the ballroom in absolute chaos, Celestia has only one word of advice for her student, ""Run,"" prompting Twilight to call for her friends to follow her. On the way down the stairs, Rarity drops one of her glass slippers. Pinkie observes that Rarity's ""prince"" will be able to find her. But she doesn't want anything to do with him, so she crushes the glass slipper and runs off with Pinkie Pie.    Meanwhile, a dejected Spike demands another doughnut while sitting at the empty counter of his favorite doughnut shop. Twilight and her friends, in their tattered gala dresses, walk in through the door. They are greeted by the server,  , who remarks to Twilight, ""Long time no see."" Around a table with a large plate of donuts, the ponies tell Spike the story of their night, prompting him to comment, ""That sounds like the   night ever,"" to which they all reply, ""It was,"" with laughter. Twilight says she hopes that Princess Celestia isn't upset with them for ruining the party. Celestia enters the doughnut shop right then with the announcement that the night has been the best Gala ever, informing the ponies that the Grand Galloping Gala is ""always awful,"" which is why she hoped Twilight and her friends' involvement would liven things up. The ponies conclude that being together made a horrible night into the best night ever (and appeared to have apologized to Spike for not including him in the event).

As the class leaves, a large crack spreads across the draconequus statue and a cackle is heard.    After the introduction,   is flying above   when a fast-moving pink cloud sends her spinning. She discovers that the cloud is made of cotton candy, and the sky fills with cotton candy clouds that rain chocolate milk.   is harvesting corn when Rainbow Dash alights and complains about the crazy weather. Suddenly, the kernels on the corn start popping, and popcorn fills the field.   is delighted by the delicious abnormalities.   shows up in a purple rainsuit and matching umbrella. Even as she speaks, the apples on the trees swell, making the trees sag with their weight. Applejack yells at   to control the squirrels and rabbits who are feeding on the enormous apples, but the forest creatures' legs elongate (like the legs of creatures in   paintings  ).  arrives with  , and says she has a new ""fail-safe"" spell to reverse the strange changes to the weather and animals. She casts the spell and a bright purple band of magic sweeps the land, but nothing happens. Undeterred, she tells Rainbow Dash to corral the clouds and Applejack to lasso them. Twilight instructs Fluttershy to coax the animals into eating the cotton candy clouds and popcorn instead of the apples. Not long after, Spike receives a letter from  , telling the six ponies to come to Canterlot immediately.    They meet the Princess in a corridor lined with stained glass windows. Celestia explains that the strange weather is being caused by  , a creature that existed in   long ago. Discord’s rule caused unrest and unhappiness for all ponies until Celestia and   defeated with the  . However, since the two Princesses cannot wield the Elements any more, Celestia tells the six ponies that they must use the Elements once again to defeat Discord. When Twilight promises that the princess can count on them, Pinkie interrupts, saying that chaos is a good thing if chocolate rain is involved. Princess Celestia opens a locked door with her horn and takes out a box, but she and the friends discover that the Elements are missing from it. Suddenly, Discord's voice echoes around the room, and he animates a depiction of himself in one of the stained glass windows. Discord comments on each element that the six friends represent, and poses a riddle:  Twilight deduces that Discord has hidden the Elements inside the castle's outdoor hedge maze.    As they approach the maze, Rainbow Dash confidently flies up to get a view of the maze, but her wings vanish and she crashes to the ground. A moment later, Fluttershy's wings and Twilight and Rarity’s horns go missing. In a flash, Discord appears, and explains that they are going to play a game to find the Elements of Harmony. The two rules are: Hedges spring up and separate the friends, who agree to meet in the middle of the maze.    As Applejack tries to navigate the maze, she spots three apples, like the ones on her cutie mark, rolling away from her on the ground. She follows them to the edge of an apple orchard. Apples start falling off the trees, and start animating themselves; they taunt her, and tell her to look in a pool nearby. She does so, and sees a vision of the six friends arguing and agreeing to never speak to each other again. The camera pans up, showing Discord using puppet crosses to animate the apples. Applejack cannot accept the idea that she needs to lie to preserve her friendship with the other ponies, and Discord hypnotizes her, draining her of color. Almost immediately the orchard fades, and a section of hedge vanishes behind her, revealing Twilight. Twilight tells her friend that she heard talking, and asks her who she was talking to; Applejack denies speaking, looking around shiftily. Twilight wonders whether she lied but remembers that ""Applejack wouldn't lie.""   Pinkie hops merrily through the maze until she stumbles upon a garden filled with balloons similar to those on her cutie mark. The balloons have smiling faces and are laughing. She giggles with the balloons until one of the balloons' strings trip her. She tumbles into a puddle of mud and stops laughing, but the balloons start jeering at her. Discord appears to Pinkie and tells her that the balloons, like her friends, are actually laughing   her, not   her. She initially denies it, but when Discord makes her friends' faces appear on the balloons, she sees that laughter can be cruel and hurtful. Discord hypnotizes her and turns her gray. The balloons pop to reveal Twilight and Applejack. Pinkie rejects Twilight’s greeting and walks away. Applejack lies again, saying she didn’t notice anything wrong with Pinkie. Twilight decides to pick up the pace before the stress ""gets the better of all of [them].""   Rarity is complaining about having to do ""outdoor sports"" when she finds a large rock blocking her path. Embedded in it are three diamonds shaped like her cutie mark. Discord appears in the diamonds' reflections and tells Rarity it's her lucky day for finding the beautiful diamonds, ""the one thing in Equestria that could rival [his] face for sheer beauty."" He starts to hypnotize Rarity, but she resists and tries to walk away. However, she succumbs and runs back to the rock, losing her color as she chips away at the rock. She unearths what appears to be a huge diamond. As she starts to carry it away, the remainder of the rock breaks apart, revealing Twilight, Applejack, and Pinkie. Twilight’s greeting is cut short when she sees Rarity carrying a large boulder. Rarity becomes very protective of her ""diamond,"" refusing to share it with the others.   Fluttershy cautiously climbs out of the hedge she has been hiding in, and starts giving herself a pep talk. Three butterflies like the ones on her cutie mark appear. Not wanting to be left alone, she decides to follow them. The butterflies turn out to be Discord in disguise. He tries to convince her that her friends think she is helpless and laugh at her behind her back. Fluttershy accepts the fact that she   helpless and that her friends are kind enough to understand. Again, Discord tries to corrupt her, and Fluttershy resists, saying that her friends want her to know of her flaws so she can improve on them. Frustrated, Discord gives up and hypnotizes her by simply prodding her head. A section of hedge disappears, revealing the others. When Twilight greets Fluttershy, she insults Twilight and smacks her with her tail. Fluttershy even knocks Pinkie Pie into a hedge. As Applejack laughs at Pinkie and Pinkie retorts, Twilight realizes that something is happening to her friends. She tries to assist Rarity with moving her rock, but Rarity warns her that the rock belongs to her.    Rainbow Dash runs through the maze and suddenly spots a cloud that looks like her cutie mark. Believing it to be her element, she chases it, only to find Discord lying on a hammock made of clouds. Ignoring Discord's attempts to be civil, Rainbow Dash tells him to prepare for a fight. Discord tells her that he is only there to deliver a riddle about the consequences of picking the wrong choice. He hypnotizes her by showing a vision of   collapsing. He drains her color and makes a box appear, giving her the choice of taking her wings from the box and leaving, or staying in the maze forever.     Meanwhile, Twilight tries to reassure herself, saying that Rainbow Dash would never let them down. However, Applejack spots Rainbow Dash flying away from the maze. Discord appears and tells the ponies that Rainbow Dash broke the ""no wings, no magic"" rule. He declares that the game is over and says:  The star background in which corrupted Applejack, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash are over is the same as Twilight's background in  .

Rarity refuses to go inside, saying she's on to Twilight's ""plan"" to steal "" "" from her. Twilight finds out that Tom is Rarity's name for the boulder. Resigned, Twilight levitates the boulder and crashes it through the door, leaving a giant hole in the wall. Once inside, Twilight asks   to retrieve the book about the Elements of Harmony, but her friends play a game of Keep Away with the book, keeping it out of her reach. Once Twilight finally gets her hooves on the book, she finds that all of the Elements of Harmony are tucked away inside.

Twilight attempts to combine the elements' power to defeat Discord, with Spike standing in for Rainbow Dash, but nothing happens. As the ponies go their separate ways, Twilight's colors turn dull and she sheds a tear that splatters in the shape of a broken heart. Discord celebrates his victory as Ponyville is driven even deeper into total chaos.    Twilight throws away her element of magic tiara and tells Spike that they are leaving Ponyville. However, Spike starts regurgitating a seemingly endless pile of scrolls from Princess Celestia, which turn out to be all of the   Twilight had sent to her during her time in Ponyville. After reading her own friendship reports, Twilight remembers the importance of friendship, regains her resolve and color, and sets out to restore the rest of her friends.   Twilight finds Applejack at  , and uses a memory spell to project memories of past adventures with her friends into Applejack's mind. Applejack regains her color and goes back to her original self.

This prompts Dash to grab onto ""Cloudsdale"" and fly away. Twilight, Rarity, Applejack and Pinkie Pie give chase in the balloon, which Fluttershy is pulling. Applejack manages to lasso Rainbow Dash, but the rope catches on Pinkie Pie and Rarity's hooves, dragging them out of the balloon as Rarity yells that Pinkie was supposed to secure the rope, still attached to the elusive Pegasus. Fluttershy is unable to keep up until she is reminded about Discord's rule over Ponyville.

In a state of extreme anxiety, Twilight speculates that the Princess could punish her with an exam to prove she has been taking her studies seriously, which Twilight fears she would fail, prompting the Princess to send her back to   Kindergarten. Twilight envisions herself sitting in a classroom surrounded by mocking foals, but the thought is 'popped' by Spike as he reasons that the Princess would never allow such a thing to happen.

She starts hallucinating small filly ponies laughing at her before Spike intervenes, revealing that the ""laughing ponies"" are just some fillies innocently playing jump rope nearby.

Princess Celestia shows her immense faith in her student, and says that she does not require a letter every week. Twilight's friends barge in and plead for the Princess to be merciful to her student: they admit that they were wrong for denying Twilight's help when she needed it most, and they apologize. In lieu of a punishment for Twilight, Princess Celestia requests that all of Twilight's friends write her   about friendship from now on, but only when they actually find one. Before she leaves, she tells Twilight that Spike made her aware of Twilight's fears getting the best of her, and after she leaves, Twilight gives Spike a loving hug.

Pinkie Pie and her group of foals run through town, as a cloaked Princess Luna lands in the marketplace. Everyone bows in fearful respect of the Princess. Twilight, however, shows no fear and wants to meet her. Princess Luna makes a speech in a very strong and dramatic voice, explaining that she only seeks the love and affection of her subjects, and wishes to improve the festival and the way it portrays her. Unfortunately, her presentation only serves to further intimidate everyone.   After assuring a frightened Spike that Luna is   Nightmare Moon anymore, Twilight realizes that the Princess is having trouble adjusting to modern times after being imprisoned for a millennium, and goes to talk to her. Feeling rejected, Luna leaves the market, and spends some time in front of the statue of Nightmare Moon, which is where Twilight finds her. Luna compliments Twilight on her costume, noting its accuracy to the smallest detail, becoming the first one to recognize the character.

Luna accidentally scares the wind out of Fluttershy, scaring off Pinkie Pie and her group of fillies once again.    The scene cross-fades to  , where the villagers are enjoying the festivities, playing games, and dancing. Princess Luna and Twilight find Applejack in the town square, and Twilight asks Applejack to give suggestions to Luna on how to be more approachable. Applejack's top tip is to have fun. Luna doesn't know what ""fun"" is, but she uncertainly tries her hoof at several carnival games. Enjoying the games, Luna shows her surprise and appreciation, and the town begins to regard her more warmly. She even goes so far as to tell her subjects to do away with the formality of ""Princess"" and simply call her Luna.   However, when Luna rushes to save Pipsqueak from drowning in the apple-bobbing tub, Pinkie Pie mistakenly thinks she is eating the foal, and once again the ponies draw away in fear. Luna tries again to gain their trust with fun but goes a bit too far and causes havoc across the town. Fed up and offended, she declares that Nightmare Night is canceled forever.    Twilight once again sets out to find Princess Luna, and finds her walking sadly across a bridge, disappointed by her inability to win the hearts of her subjects. She rejects Twilight's help at first, so Twilight finds another method. Luring Pinkie Pie into an alleyway with a trail of candy, she tells her that Princess Luna is no longer evil and instructs her to stop shrieking whenever she sees her. Pinkie Pie agrees, but as she is about to shake hooves with Princess Luna and make peace, Rainbow Dash inopportunely plays her lightning prank, making Pinkie Pie believe it is Princess Luna who made the lightning.

Twilight blocks Pinkie Pie's path by teleporting in the way and pins her down, adamantly telling her that Princess Luna has not come to harm them. However, Pinkie Pie tells her that she is fully aware that Luna won't actually ""gobble up"" anyone, but she is scared because it is   to be scared. This inspires a plan in Twilight's mind. As the ponies clean up the mess in the town square, Zecora and the Mayor remind the foals that they still have to give their offerings of candy to Nightmare Moon. Once they have left their offerings at the Nightmare Moon statue, Princess Luna makes a dramatic appearance in her dark alter-ego, scaring them yet again. She transforms back into Princess Luna and pops out a set of fake fangs, but is still afraid that Twilight's plan will fail. However, Pipsqueak then tugs on her mane to ask her something; even if there won't be any more Nightmare Nights, could she still come back next year to scare them? Princess Luna looks past him to see the other foals looking hopefully at her. To her puzzlement, Pipsqueak confirms that the way that she scared them is really fun, and Nightmare Night is his favorite night of the year. Smiling, Luna proclaims that Nightmare Night will have to be reinstated. Pipsqueak tells her that she's his favorite Princess and hugs her. He turns around and tells his friends that she agreed, and the foals cheer. Twilight tells the Princess that they really do like her after all.   Back in town, Luna participates in more carnival games, personally accepts more candy offerings from the foals, and has fun scaring more ponies. At the end of the episode, Rainbow Dash once again shows up with her thundercloud, and when she is eagerly about to prank Twilight and Spike, Princess Luna gives her a taste of her own medicine, scaring off Dash. Twilight learned that one of the best things about   is to give it to others and help them find it themselves. Also, everyone in Ponyville learned that even if someone is intimidating or scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath.

Sweetie Belle heads on over to   where   is doing chores with Apple Bloom. Seeing their enjoyment as they perform tasks together, Sweetie Belle notes that Applejack, unlike Rarity, is what a sister should be - kind, patient, active, and fun.    Later, as Rarity restarts her fashion line, she is struck by a new idea due to Sweetie Belle's organization and completes her new line, ""Full Spectrum Fashions"". She begins to forgive Sweetie Belle, but quickly stops herself, only to soften again when she finds the sweater Sweetie Belle shrank was perfect for  , and not herself. Rarity's ultimate realization of her mistake comes up after looking, a second time, at the picture that Sweetie Belle made her. While decorating a dress with baby blue sapphires, Rarity decides to take a few from her sister's picture. The picture is revealed to be an image of herself and Sweetie Belle superimposed into a heart made out of sapphires. This makes Rarity realize that what she said and did was wrong. Rarity goes to Sweet Apple Acres in order to apologize, but finds that Sweetie is with Applejack and does not want to be with her anymore. Sweetie Belle then claims Applejack as her big sister, much to the dismay of everypony. Sweetie Belle continues berating Rarity while praising Applejack, going so far as to say that Rarity could learn how to be a better sister from Applejack. Rarity pleads for Sweetie to return, but shows that she hasn't fully learned the true meaning of sisterhood as she continues suggesting activities that appeal to her rather than Sweetie, hinting that she still does not understand. Sweetie Belle is not impressed and storms off angrier than before. Applejack helps Rarity understand what sisterhood means (comparing it to apple pie) and Rarity finally realizes that she has   been a good sister to Sweetie Belle after all, so she decides she must do whatever it takes to regain her sister.    At the day of the event, which takes place at Sweet Apple Acres, Apple Bloom and Applejack agree that Applejack can be Sweetie Belle's sister for the day. They enter the race together, but Applejack falls into the mud of the first obstacle. Rarity emerges from the mud, wearing Applejack's hat and remaining silent throughout the race, making Sweetie Belle believe she's still racing with Applejack. Rarity's blue eyes are still visible though, as opposed to Applejack's green, though her eye style is the same as Applejack's. They manage to jump over the haystacks, quickly eat the apple pies, fill a jar with grape juice, and carefully place their egg from a hen house into a basket. While they don't win the race, only coming up short to   and  , Sweetie Belle says she doesn't mind because she had so much fun. Applejack's hat falls off, revealing a white horn. Sweetie Belle wipes the mud from Rarity's flank and, after seeing her three-diamond  , discovers she'd been racing with her own sister the entire time, while Applejack stayed under the mud the entire race and only now surfaced. Sweetie Belle finds out that Applejack, Rarity, and Apple Bloom were all in on the plan. The sisters make up, and Rarity offers to go to the spa as a treat, but the rest of the girls burst out laughing, thinking Rarity is just joking, but she insists she wasn't.  The sisters compose a   to   together, in which they inform her that, while being sisters is wonderful, it often requires teamwork, sometimes is about compromise, sometimes is about accepting each other's differences, but mostly is about having fun.   In the end, they disagree again, over whether it's okay to get one's hooves a little dirty or a lot dirty when having fun. Since   is writing the letter he gives them a happy medium of a medium amount of dirty (not too little, not too much, just right), and they agree on this compromise.      "
"The Cutie Pox","Amy Keating Rogers","2011-11-12","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cutie_Pox"," is the sixth   of the second season of   and the thirty-second episode overall. The episode centers around the titular illness that afflicts  , which causes many   to appear all over her body, making her constantly utilize the skills they symbolize. The term   is used to describe a variety diseases characterized by pockmarks, and in the archaic sense, it may refer to disease in general.   The library scene was at the animation rough cut stage on August 2, 2011.  Two name options for   that weren't used were Pony Bowl-ony and Mr. Incredi-Bowl.  There were several deleted scenes of Apple Bloom displaying more cutie mark talents, one of which was a 'scootering' talent, which outraged Scootaloo.     The episode opens with the   outside a bowling alley, hoping to earn their   in bowling. They briefly brainstorm new team names (since, after obtaining their cutie marks, ""Cutie Mark Crusaders"" would then be obsolete) like ""The Three Strikes"" and ""The Pin Twins"", before settling on ""The Bowling Dolls"".  rolls her ball into the gutter—but remains in high spirits—and   bucks her ball and sends it flying all over the alley before it too rolls into the gutter.   clumsily rolls her ball and appears to knock over all of her pins. The crowd of ponies cheers, with   remarking, ""Cool! A bowling cutie mark!"" Apple Bloom excitedly examines her flank, which is still bare, and sees that the crowd's cheers were directed toward   who'd just gotten   cutie mark. To Apple Bloom's disappointment, her ball hadn't knocked over even one pin.    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle comment on how much fun they had bowling, while Apple Bloom dejectedly walks alongside them. Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle try to cheer her up with a cupcake from  , a party with  , and a new hat from  , but none of these work, and Apple Bloom remains despondent. She sulks off alone and wanders into the  , where she trips over a tree root, tumbles down a small ridge, and chips a tooth.   finds her and brings her to her hut to give her a potion for her tooth. Apple Bloom expresses her frustration about her cutie mark, and Zecora tells her that she simply needs to wait for the right time for it to appear. Apple Bloom takes Zecora's tooth-fixing potion, and her tooth is instantly mended. She then looks at the various potions and tonics around Zecora's hut, looking for a possible brew to bring about a cutie mark. When Zecora begins to make a potion to help a rooster fix his morning call, Apple Bloom notices a flower called 'Heart's Desire', which causes one's talent to ""come into view"" and will supposedly help the rooster crow again. Zecora goes out to find amethysts to complete her potion, and Apple Bloom sets her sights on the flower in the bowl.    In the schoolyard, Apple Bloom exuberantly shows off her new cutie mark: a silver hoop. Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and   try to figure out what special talent her cutie mark represents, to which Apple Bloom reveals to be loopty-hooping. She demonstrates her skill at loopty-hooping and various other tricks, with other foals cheering her on, much to the annoyance of   and  .   hears the foals cheering Apple Bloom on and sees her prowess with the hoop, asking her to give the class a demonstration and help them play with hoops. While performing an advanced hoop trick, Apple Bloom suddenly sprouts a   cutie mark: an image of plates rotating on top of poles. Diamond Tiara suggests the cutie marks are fake, but Apple Bloom denies it.   and   throw her two plates and poles. Apple Bloom balances the poles on her nose and spins the plates on top while twirling a hoop around her tail. The class is astounded by Apple Bloom's talents and cheers for her as they make their way down the streets of  . In the streets, she nimbly performs tricks such as using a well-thrown hoop to style  's mane in the manner of Rarity's.    That night,   takes a tired Apple Bloom home, and   and   congratulate her. Applejack tells her how proud they are of her getting not one but  cutie marks. After a long day of performing tricks, Apple Bloom heads off to bed. Late at night, Applejack is rolling around in bed, being kept awake by an incessant tapping. She gets out of bed to investigate and discovers that the sound is coming from Apple Bloom's room. Upon opening the door, she sees Apple Bloom tapping her hooves frantically, as well as yet   cutie mark on Apple Bloom's flank: a tapping shoe. Apple Bloom, unable to stop herself from exercising her ""talents"" all at once, cries out for help while Applejack looks horrified.   Unable to stop Apple Bloom from moving, Applejack takes her to Twilight's   to search for a cure.   retrieves the book   for Twilight, and locates Apple Bloom's affliction: ""cutie pox"". The book describes this bizarre disease as being ""a puzzling pony plague"" that afflicted a population of ponies in the Paleopony period. Random cutie marks appeared all over the bodies of those affected, making them perform the talents that came with them. Unfortunately, neither a cure nor the cause of the breakout was ever discovered, and the cutie pox disappeared as mysteriously as they had arrived. At that moment, Apple Bloom sprouts a fourth cutie mark in the form of a fleur-de-lis and starts to speak in French. The three ponies decide it best to seek out Zecora for help.   While on their way to Zecora's home, Apple Bloom's cutie pox begins to progress more quickly, with each new mark causing her to perform strange and arduous talents, mostly at the same time. The townsponies become scared of Apple Bloom's strange behavior, believing her to be hexed, cursed, or enchanted. Spike tactlessly points out the true nature of the disease to the townsponies, causing them to panic, lock themselves into their houses, and run off. When Zecora comes into town, she almost thinks that the ponies were still afraid of her. Twilight and Applejack tell her of Apple Bloom's affliction. Zecora says that around the time Apple Bloom was alone in her hut, some of her ingredients ""mysteriously"" went missing, especially the rest of a certain special flower. Fortunately, Zecora has the cure for the cutie pox: the Seeds of Truth, which only bloom when ""words true and pure"" are spoken. Applejack plants the seeds in the ground and pleads for somepony to tell the truth. Pinkie Pie attempts to confess to eating more corncakes than she claimed she did, but the seeds don't bloom. Apple Bloom, speaking English again, finally admits to her misdeed. She admits her cutie marks are all fake and that she stole the ingredients—most importantly the Heart's Desire—from Zecora. During the process, the townsponies all begin to calm down when they hear Apple Bloom's truth. Just as promised, the Seeds of Truth bloom into a flower, which Apple Bloom quickly ingests, causing her cutie pox to vanish. Apple Bloom apologizes to everyone for the entire ordeal (including lying) - especially to Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo for getting too carried away with her cutie mark quest and to Zecora for taking her ingredients without permission. Realizing how sorry Apple Bloom is for everything and how she learned from her mistakes, Zecora and Apple Bloom's friends accept her apology.   Apple Bloom writes a   to   about what she learned: there are no shortcuts to getting something you desire the most, including a cutie mark, and that good things come to those who wait. However, immediately after Spike sends the letter, the Cutie Mark Crusaders decide they've waited long enough and run off into the distance, eager to again try and get their cutie marks.     The Heart's Desire plant is introduced by   as a cure for a rooster who ""lost his crow"". She says that ""with Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view"".   takes interest in the plant, and encourages Zecora to leave while she eyes the bowl with the plant's petals.  When Apple Bloom develops a third cutie mark and discovers that she's unable to stop performing the various talents the marks signify, she's taken to  's  . After consulting her books, Twilight diagnoses the ailment as cutie pox. ""This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony period. Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them. The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappeared as mysteriously as they arrived."" Twilight suggests that Zecora might have a cure.    The Seeds of Truth are the cure to the cutie pox. Zecora stops by   and witnesses all the ponies running scared from Apple Bloom's condition. She offers a cure for the cutie pox: ""A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth. These seeds must be planted in the ground, with the truth they'll grow and the cure is found."" Apple Bloom eventually confesses that her   are all fake, and that she figured the   would help her get what she wanted most, so she ""mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it""; following her confession, the Seeds of Truth grow into a white-and-pink flower which Apple Bloom promptly consumes, and all of her cutie marks disappear.  Throughout the episode, various cutie marks and talents afflict Apple Bloom. The following list of cutie marks and talents is sorted by time of appearance.  One of the cutie marks Apple Bloom receives is a red shoe which causes her to dance uncontrollably, like the main character in the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale  . The equations Apple Bloom draws under the affliction of the Math cutie mark are difficult to identify without context, but the first two sections state the equivalence between integration of continuous functions and the sigma operation upon discrete functions - a concept important in digital signal processing. The meaning of the remaining three equations has yet to be determined, and they may be simply random math-symbols to fill the board.      "

They tell her that they always come down to the park at the same time every week with their pets to play with them. The ponies try to make Rainbow understand why they don't invite her, but Rainbow, who is the only pony without a pet, exclaims that she understands and sees no reason for them to invite her if she doesn't even have a pet.   However, after hearing the noise from the ponies playing with their pets, Rainbow Dash flies back down from her tree to them and says that she would like a pet at some point. Thrilled, Fluttershy brings her to her   to show off her collection of animals. Fluttershy and Rainbow break into   as Fluttershy shows Rainbow her wonderful choices of pets. Rainbow insists she wants a ""cool pet that will be able to keep up with her,"" and selects a group of flying animals but is unable to decide. To make a firm decision, she holds a series of contests to determine which pet will be hers. As she prepares to begin, Fluttershy brings in a tortoise who she says wants to compete. Rainbow reluctantly agrees.   The first test is that of speed, a race around a track which a falcon wins. The second test is a test of agility across an obstacle course in which a hummingbird wins. The third test is of guts, where the pets have to get Opal's favorite mouse toy away from her. The butterfly easily achieves this by mesmerizing Opal into a daze, then stealing her toy. The fourth test is of style, which is done by having Rainbow pose in a snapshot with each of the animals. It is not revealed which animal passes this test. The fifth test is of coolness, where Rainbow judges the animals by their calls, of which the eagle wins. The sixth test is of awesomeness, which the owl wins because of his ability to rotate his head. The seventh test is of radicalness, in which the bat plays the   theme song on a  , among feats by the other contestants.

Still unable to choose, Rainbow decides to hold a race in Ghastly Gorge, pitting the last four contestants, the eagle, the falcon, the owl, and the bat against  , with the tortoise tagging along with the other contestants. Rainbow tells them that whichever contestant crosses the finish line with her has proven that it can keep up with her, and is worthy of being her pet. The flying pets remain very close during the race, while the tortoise is last, sweating as he tries to catch up with Rainbow. The falcon gets stuck in bramble bushes, but the bat, eagle, and owl make it through. The falcon catches up later with his wing curled up. Near the caves with the  , the bat is almost devoured but manages to get away. While distracted, Rainbow hits a wall, and there is a rock slide. The racers suddenly get ahead of Rainbow while she falls behind with her wing stuck underneath a large rock. She desperately calls for help, stuck under the boulder with no one to help her. She spots the tortoise slowly approaching her, and laments about how she'll have to spend the rest of her life with the tortoise as well as being trapped by a rock. The tortoise digs a small hole under the rock and sticks his head in it. Weeping, Rainbow completely gives up hope. The tortoise, however, lifts the rock with his head, freeing Rainbow's wing.   At the finish line, Rainbow's friends await her arrival. Noticing that only the four racers finish the race, they begin to worry about Rainbow. Applejack spots a rock slide through Twilight's binoculars, but also spots Rainbow riding on the tortoise with her right wing bandaged. Rainbow and the tortoise finish the race, and the other ponies tell Rainbow to meet her new pet, the falcon.  However, Rainbow doesn't feel right with the falcon as her pet, even if it is everything she wanted. She says that her pet would be the one that finished the race   her, and the tortoise is the only one who did so. With this in mind, she accepts the tortoise as her new pet, thanking him for saving her. The sad falcon shakes hands (so to speak) with the tortoise and leaves.

The episode was called ""Giving Dangerously"", then ""Attack of the 50 Foot Dragon"", before changing to its current title,  a play on the phrase ""secret of my success"". The previous title hints more to the episode's ""giant monster rampaging through the city"" theme popularized by the 1954 film  , whereas the first title plays on the phrase ""living dangerously."" The kidnapping of Rarity and subsequent aerial assault on Spike draws parallels with the classic 1933 film  .    The episode begins with   holding a ""re-shelving day"", which involves her taking all the   books off the shelves and sorting them. While sorting books, she gets distracted by  , who is busy admiring his birthday present to himself, an almost-ripe fire ruby that has been ""aging [for] months"".   then walks into the library and spots Spike's fire ruby, going on excitedly about its qualities.

Applejack reminds him that he's already thanked her fifteen times, and he explains that he is just so grateful for their kindness, and wishes for the party to last forever. Hearing this, Pinkie Pie tells Spike that the party can't last forever because he has to go to   so he can collect the special surprise that   baked for his birthday.   Spike hurries to Sugarcube Corner where the Cakes give him a sparkling, mouth-watering sapphire-studded cupcake. On his way home, he bumps into   and drops the cupcake but manages to catch it with his long forked tongue. He apologizes to Cheerilee, then eats the entire cupcake and helps her gather her dropped items.

While walking through Ponyville, Spike reasons that when ponies learn of his birthday, they will shower him with presents.

Twilight interrupts his spiel by tugging at his ""ear"" and apologizes to Junebug for Spike getting carried away. When Twilight chides Spike, he appears to be remorseful and promises to give Cheerilee her hat back, but as soon as Twilight leaves, he puts the hat back on and asks ""Who else has a present for Spikey-wikey?"" The shot is accompanied by rattlesnake sounds, with Spike blinking with vertical eyelids and sticking out a wiggling forked tongue.    The next morning, Twilight wakes up to find a larger, ganglier Spike sleeping under a pile of accumulated presents. He looks at his new limbs and claws, and in a brief shot from his perspective, valuable items in the library shimmer. Twilight tries to talk to him, but he gets distracted by a glistening globe. Twilight takes away the globe, but Spike grabs it back and stacks it on a pile of objects. He asks to take one of the books, but Twilight takes it away from him and comments on how grabby he is. When he replies, he finds his voice has deepened and becomes concerned about the changes. Twilight takes him to the pediatrician   and then the veterinarian  , hoping to find out what's wrong with him. However, neither has any experience with dragons, while Spike continues to hoard objects. Finally, she visits  , who explains:  The frame expands to show everything from Zecora's hut missing, the door open, and Spike missing.    Twilight gallops back to Ponyville and finds Spike trying to pull  's scooter from her grasp. Twilight lures him back to the library with an ""amazing broom"", and on his way, he grows larger and starts walking on all fours. She tosses the broom into one of the rooms and shuts the door; Spike struggles to break through but then goes quiet. When she comes in to check, she finds him clutching a pile of books. She removes all the books and closes the door again, but then she hears loud crashing noises and finds a Spike-shaped hole in the library wall, with Spike gone again. The scene wipes to Applejack wondering ""Now   in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my  ?"" Twilight rushes to her and asks for her help to lasso Spike. Applejack laughs at the idea of Spike running wild, but then he runs past them with a pile of leaves and apples. Twilight and Applejack chase Spike with a length of rope and lunge at him, but they miss and manage to tie themselves to a tree while Spike continues rampaging. Rainbow Dash spots them and laughs at their predicament when Fluttershy's distant scream cuts her short. The three find her hiding in a tree, and she tells them ""a giant, rampaging dragon stormed through"", who pulled her chicken coop out of the ground and filled it with ""apples and stuff"".   The ponies next hear Pinkie Pie scream, and they find her pelting Spike with cakes while he collects some of them into his chicken coop of stuff. Spike grows so large that he crashes through the ceiling of Sugarcube Corner. As the others chase after Spike, Applejack tows Pinkie along by the tail, who can only stare in shock at her half-destroyed workplace.    While Rarity tries on her cape at  , Spike's gigantic eye peeks through the window, and he reaches in to kidnap Rarity. The scene fades to alarm sirens going off, which Spike grabs. Ponies panic in the streets of Ponyville while Spike rampages and tears off the top of a water tower to stash his hoard in it. He roars at Rarity, who he has held captive with the end of his tail. Rainbow Dash hovers on one side of Spike, screaming at him to let Rarity go, while Fluttershy politely entreats him on the other side. Spike refuses to listen to them, turns around and swings Rarity at them. Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy get caught up in Rarity's magenta cape, which tears off, sending the two falling into a river. The   fly overhead and make some close fly-bys to Spike, accompanied by the sound of polishing blades. Spike spots a nearby steep mountain and climbs it, Rarity dangling along. The Wonderbolts fly even closer to him and one of them shaves off some of Spike's spines with sheer speed. Spike empties the water tower tank into a cave, uses it to catch the Wonderbolts, then lodges the tank into the side of the mountain to trap them inside.   Rarity launches into an angry diatribe, culminating in taking the remnants of her ripped cape and declaring it a ""crime against fashion"". Spike notices the fire ruby that she is wearing, and Rarity, seeing that it got his attention, tells him she won't let him have   gemstone: ""This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey... the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!"" Spike looks at the gem wide-eyed and flashes back to the moment when he gave her the ruby and how she kissed his cheek. He touches his cheek and starts quaking, then winces and zaps into his old self. The tiny Spike and Rarity remain airborne for several seconds before plummeting. Rarity, shocked, realizes that Spike   the rampaging dragon. Spike tries to confess about his crush, but Rarity stops him and smiles, her eyes welling with tears and Spike smiles back. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy speed towards the two with the ripped cape from the river and catch Spike and Rarity in the air, safely lowering them to the ground. With the emergency over, the shot cuts to the water tank on the mountainside which peels off revealing the Wonderbolts huddled together, shivering. They notice that the tank fell off, strike a gallant pose to the sound of a hunting horn, and fly off.    Spike sits sadly on the bridge and places his hand in one of the giant footprints he made. Rarity comes up and says she's proud of him for stopping himself from destroying Ponyville, calling him her hero and giving him a kiss. The scene cross-fades to Spike narrating and writing a   to   about the values of kindness and generosity, which are ""  Well... almost anything."" He turns to face the other way to reveal his cheek to the camera with Rarity's kiss framed like a picture. The episode ends with a kiss-shaped   on Spike's cheek.     "

Rainbow Dash, in contrast, thinks that the show should be all about her, since she's the star. Meanwhile, a window is open causing a cold wind to blow through backstage. Rarity asks   to close the window, but Applejack chides Rainbow Dash about the true meaning of the play. Eventually,   comes to inform the ponies that curtain is in two minutes, while the argument over who should close the window continues.   The episode features a play put up by the ponies in Canterlot for Hearth's Warming Eve. The cast and crew are as follows:   The ponies are then called on stage, and the play begins. The play is about the history of ponykind and how   was founded. Spike narrates, providing an introduction. He explains that the   grew food, and in payment for providing weather, the   demanded some of the food. The   also demanded payment for magically raising the sun and moon. None of the tribes cared what happened to each other. This fragile relationship continues until a large blizzard comes along causing a food shortage.   Without any food, the leaders of each pony tribe meet up to discuss what to do. The meeting however goes poorly, as each of the leaders continues to argue with each other. After the assembly, three ghostly horses are shown overlooking the Earth below from a passage in the clouds; they are later identified as  . Each of the leaders returns to their second-in-command and explains that the meeting went poorly because the other leaders refused to cooperate. Smart Cookie then tells Chancellor Puddinghead that they are out of food, and Chancellor Puddinghead exclaims ""I am  !"" She decides that they need to grow food somewhere else, and each leader comes to the conclusion that they must find new land to inhabit.   Commander Hurricane and Private Pansy fly through clouds, while Princess Platinum and Clover the Clever travel through a forest, and while Chancellor Puddinghead and Smart Cookie travel across a gem-encrusted mountainside. Each tribe leader finds their ideal land, and claims it for their tribe. Commander Hurricane names her land ""Pegasopolis."" Princess Platinum naming her land ""Unicornia,"" and Chancellor Puddinghead naming her land ""Earth"" as a recommendation from Smart Cookie to replace her first choice of ""Dirtville."" They soon discover that each tribe has claimed the same land, and of course more arguments ensue about who gets to own the land. Commander Hurricane calls for a fight to the land, but each of the advisers votes for everyone to just calm down. Chancellor Puddinghead throws snowballs at Commander Hurricane and Princess Platinum, causing everyone to realize that the blizzard has once again returned.    To escape the blizzard, the ponies make their way into a cave. Once in the cave, they continue to argue over who gets what part of the cave. Due to their constant arguing, the windigos once again return, causing an ice blizzard, which freezes each of the leaders solid. Clover the Clever identifies the creatures, saying her mentor   taught her about them. The advisers, however, manage to hold good relations to each other, regardless of the different tribes they hail from. They deduce that the leaders' arguing is what caused all of this, and tell stories and sing, the songs of which became the carols that are still sung in Equestria today. With their continued display of friendship, Smart Cookie, Clover the Clever and Private Pansy manage to melt the ice surrounding their leaders and incinerate the windigos through the   of the  . In the end, all the tribes learn that the warmth of harmony and love to each other can conquer over the coldness of hatred and grief.

Once the play is over, backstage, Twilight concludes that the Princess chose them to perform the play because they exemplify what good friends are. They then notice that the window is still open (or open again), and then they all start arguing about who will close the window. However, when they hear a sound that sounds like the distant wail of a windigo, Rainbow Dash volunteers to close the window, without further argument. The episode ends with a shot of Canterlot with the same magical heart floating above it that broke the blizzard in the cave in the play.   The Fire of Friendship is a magical heart-shaped pink flame that does away with the   and their hate-fueled snowstorm. In the play featured in the episode, the three assistants to the pony tribe leaders manage to fight off the creatures by proclaiming that they don't hate each other after all. Clover the Clever, played by Twilight Sparkle in the play, magically produces a pink floating heart-shaped flame which melts the snow and disperses the windigos. Both Spike, as the narrator of the play, and the carol sung at the end of the performance, refer to a ""Fire of Friendship.""

"Family Appreciation Day","Cindy Morrow","2012-01-07","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Family_Appreciation_Day"," is the twelfth   of the second season of   and the thirty-eighth episode overall. In the episode,   tries to prevent   from speaking at her   for Family Appreciation Day. This is the first episode where only one of the   appears, namely  .   This episode is listed as number eleven on  's episode guide.     The episode opens at night time in   with a wolf's howl. Soon   wakes up to the clanking of pots and pans, and she is joined by  , who looks out the window with her. Outside,   is running around shouting ""the timberwolves are a-howlin'"" and ""the   are coming."" Looking out from their windows, Applejack, Apple Bloom, and   cheer and repeat that the zap apples are coming. The following morning Applejack and Big McIntosh are making preparations at the apple orchard, unloading large baskets by the bare trees. Inside the Apples' house, Apple Bloom enthusiastically exclaims to Granny Smith that she's ready to make  . Granny Smith starts by giving Apple Bloom a stick with some twigs tied to its end, prompting Apple Bloom to inquire if it is some special herbal ingredient she uses, but Granny Smith replies that it's a broom and that she should start sweeping. At the orchard, a strong wind starts blowing and the skies get covered with dark clouds. The naked trees starts buzzing with blue sparks around their branches, and soon the sparks disappear and big leaves sprout, which Applejack calls ""zap apple leaves"".    The storm clouds quickly disperse and   and her father   arrive at the farm. They watch Granny Smith and Apple Bloom jump over full watering cans singing the alphabet while wearing bunny costumes. Filthy Rich is there to do business with Granny Smith about the jam. Diamond Tiara tells Apple Bloom she must be ""so embarrassed"" by Granny Smith's ""silly ways"" and ridiculous costumes, and that she's lucky she's on the farm and not in town where everyone could see her.  The scene fades to Apple Bloom and Granny Smith in town gathering ingredients for the zap apple jam. Granny Smith sings loudly and hops along, drawing the attention of other townfolk, which makes Apple Bloom lower her head in embarrassment. Granny Smith inspects some pots and pans at a stand and chews on one of them, and leaves her false teeth attached to it then carries along. She makes smalltalk with the bees while harvesting their honey. Apple Bloom begs her grandmother to stop acting that way when Diamond Tiara and   spot them. The fillies derisively call Apple Bloom by the nickname that Granny Smith gives her, which makes her bury her head in shame and eventually beg Granny Smith to get back to the farm. Granny Smith keeps singing and prancing, and Apple Bloom pulls down her bonnet over her eyes, embarrassed.    The next scene has Filthy Rich giving a lecture about his business at the   in front of a bored, half-asleep classroom–except Diamond Tiara, who is alert and attentive. He concludes his lecture and   thanks him for being a part of Family Appreciation Day, first as ""Mr. Filthy"", but he frowns and Cheerilee quickly corrects herself to ""Mr. Rich."" Cheerilee checks her her list for the student up for the next Family Appreciation Day, and names Apple Bloom. Apple Bloom tells her that Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak because it's zap apple harvest day. Cheerilee asks if anyone else from her family could come, and Apple Bloom nervously shakes her head no, but Diamond Tiara butts in and exclaims that Granny Smith could come. Apple Bloom tries to say something, but Cheerilee quickly accepts the offer. Apple Bloom is horrified and whines to herself that she'll be the laughing stock of  .  Back at the farm, Applejack tells Apple Bloom she and Big McIntosh can't take a break from the harvest. The   manifests in a quick change in weather, a flock of crows circling the orchard in a flight pattern of an apple, and the blossoming of teal flowers on the zap apple trees. When the sign concludes, Applejack assures Apple Bloom that Granny Smith has no shortage of entertaining stories to tell.   The scene cross-fades to the  ' treehouse, where Apple Bloom shares her woes with her friends   and   in a long string of synonyms. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo tell Apple Bloom they'll help her postpone her presentation, trying tactics like faking an illness for Apple Bloom, manipulating a napping Granny Smith to say that she won't be able to make the presentation to  , trying to harvest the   early (while they get to feel the trees' magic defense), and sending Granny Smith on a train journey to see  . The last attempt works, and Granny Smith goes to visit Apple Strudel. The scene cross-fades to the schoolhouse, where Cheerilee welcomes Granny Smith for Family Appreciation Day, but she doesn't arrive. Apple Bloom explains that Granny Smith got called out of town on account of a family emergency, but right as she finishes the sentence Granny Smith enters the classroom. Apple Bloom, surprised, asks Granny Smith if she missed the train, and she replies that it came and Uncle Apple Strudel was on it. Diamond Tiara makes a snide remark about Granny Smith's memory to Silver Spoon, and afterwards Granny Smith starts her presentation.    Granny Smith tells the class that she and her family were ""pilgrim ponyfolk"" who traveled and collected seeds. In her story, ""the Smith family"" reaches   and comes across  , who stops to see their seed collection, and notices they're tired from searching for a home. She directs them to the land next to the  ; Granny's father is so grateful that he raises Celestia's hoof and kisses it (but perhaps for a bit too long than his wife appreciates, if her glaring at him is any indication).  There they build their first home with lumber from the surrounding forest and plant their first orchard, but since orchards don't grow overnight their food runs scarce. Despite having been warned of the dangers of the Everfree Forest, as her family sleeps Granny Smith decides to venture into it after dark in search of food, having reasoned that there must be food sources that support the animals living there. She soon came across a zap apple tree which just happens to be laden with ripe fruit. Having filled her saddle bags at this point, a pack of   found her and began to howl and chase after her. Granny Smith runs back to her house and begins clanging a metal pot against the cooking cauldron her mother set up outside, which drives the timberwolves away. The family takes the seeds from the zap apples and plants them in their orchard; the seeds magically grow into full size trees in an instant. Granny Smith then goes on to describe the how she paid attention to the signs of the harvest of the zap apple trees each year, how the apples all zap away if you don't pick them all in one day, and how she mixed up batches of zap apple jam. The process would come to involve the strange activities she was exhibiting earlier in the episode: being friendly with the bees so their honey would be sweet, talking to glass jars to make sure they won't crack, and that ""zap apples like pink polkadots"". As to exactly   it improves the jam, she came to chalk it up to the magic apples themselves and that magic is just funny that way. She tells that ponies started coming to the farm from far and wide for the zap apple jam, and that the first thing Diamond Tiara's great grandfather   ever sold was her zap apple jam. He would stay in the area to open a permanent store, and this came to attract more ponies to relocate to what would become the town site. She concludes, ""and that is how Ponyville was founded.""   Granny Smith's account of Ponyville's founding agrees with the account given in   by Twilight Sparkle, where she tells Spike that Ponyville was founded by Earth ponies. After Granny Smith finishes her story, Silver Spoon kicks off a round of  , to which everyone joins in. Diamond Tiara is shocked at the attention Granny Smith has received, and lashes out at her, but Apple Bloom rushes to defend Granny Smith. At the end of the episode, Apple Bloom tells Applejack that Family Appreciation Day went well and she learned that she should always appreciate and be proud of her family and friends, even if they may seem different. The episode ends with Filthy Rich, sternly pushing Diamond Tiara, wearing a big pair of bunny ears, to go and join in with other foals from school in singing to the water in the watering cans.    The zap apples are magical apples that grow in the   and the   orchard, which was the Smith family orchard when they were first planted, as told by Granny Smith to Apple Bloom's class in this episode. Granny Smith tells of how she picked the apples from trees in the Everfree Forest and planted their seeds in the Smith family orchard, and how they magically grew to full size trees and their fruits were made into various foodstuff, chiefly Granny Smith's zap apple jam, which was instrumental in the founding of  , according to her story. Zap apples were originally called ""Zapples"" and went through several other names, such as ""Zippityzapples"", ""ZipZap Apples"", ""Zipzapples"" and ""AppleZaps"", according to  .  Zap apples are first featured in this episode. They appear and disappear quickly in the span of five days, which is why   and   can't spare time from the harvest to speak at  's  . Their appearance is accompanied by signs that are numbered by  . When the   try harvesting the apples the evening before zap apple harvest day, Apple Bloom warns her friends, ""Zap apple trees aren't like normal apple trees. They're magic.""   tries bucking a tree to harvest the apples but gets electrocuted, and when the three Crusaders try picking an apple and can't manage to pull it off the branch they end up catapulting themselves from the bowed tree.    First, Granny Smith announces that the timberwolves are howling and that the zap apples are coming, although she later says that they howl ""when the zap apples first start growing"", after the other signs. The timberwolves appear in Granny Smith's flashback when she tells the story of the zap apples and the founding of   to Apple Bloom's class. Young Granny Smith enters the Everfree Forest despite its dangers in search of food. She hears a wolf's howl, and after she comes across the zap apple trees the timberwolves start gathering around her, howling and snarling. She escapes, and outruns the wolves back to the farmhouse, where she clangs pots and pans which scare away the timberwolves. ""Timberwolf"", or ""timber wolf"" is a colloquial name for some subspecies of  , or for the species itself. The timberwolves in the episode have glowing yellow eyes and their bodies look like pieces of timber.    The next day after the first sign, a sudden strong wind starts blowing and the skies get covered with dark clouds. The naked trees starts buzzing with blue sparks around their branches, and soon the sparks disappear and big leaves sprout, which Applejack calls ""zap apple leaves"". The clouds quickly disperse, and soon afterward Granny Smith tells   that the zap apples are due in four ""days, to be exact.""   The third sign is loudly pointed out by Granny Smith. There is another sudden wind and gathering of dark clouds, and a flock of crows circles above the orchard, making an apple shape with their flight pattern. Glowing teal flowers sprout on the trees and blossom into star-shaped flowers, accompanied by blue electric sparks. The clouds quickly disperse and the flowers stop glowing but remain on the trees.  The evening before zap apple harvest, the Cutie Mark Crusaders watch the zap apples sprout on the trees after a meteor shower. Apple Bloom announces that it's the fourth sign, and the three Crusaders sneak into the orchard to harvest the zap apples, though Apple Bloom warns her friends that zap apple trees are magic. The fillies fail at their attempts to pick the apples, which are still small and gray, and not rainbow-colored like the harvest-ready zap apples.    The weather changes abruptly for a final time before the zap apples are ready to harvest. There's a lightning storm over the orchard, then a rainbow shines over it, and the zap apple trees are once again teeming with electrical sparks. The zap apples turn from gray to rainbow-streaked, and rainbow-beams fire all across the orchard from the apples. An aurora-like rainbow shines behind the apple trees and the zap apples change shape from small round apples to larger, more elongated and squarish. Applejack watches the transformation and announces that the zap apple harvest has begun, and Granny Smith announces that ""tomorrow we will be makin' up some zap apple jam!""   Granny Smith tells Apple Bloom that she had been making zap apple jam since she was a little pony, and that there is ""a whole mess o' steps in this process and you gots to get each one of them just right, or  ."" When she gives her presentation to Apple Bloom's class, she mentions being friendly with the bees so their honey would be sweet, talking to glass jars, and that ""zap apples like pink polka-dots."" Early in the episode Apple Bloom and Granny Smith hop over full watering cans in bunny suits while singing the alphabet, and Apple Bloom tries to explain to Diamond Tiara the purpose of this activity, but Diamond Tiara cuts her off. Applejack later asks Apple Bloom's classmates if they want to help Granny ""sing to the water"". At the end of the episode, ponies are lining up to buy the zap apple jam that Granny Smith and Apple Bloom made, much like they did in Granny Smith's story. With the exception of Stinkin' Rich, all the ponies in the zap apple jam queue in Granny Smith's memory are the same ponies who queue up for the zap apple jam in the present day, without the sepia tone or old fashioned clothing. Granny Smith tells Apple Bloom's class that it's the zap apple jam that attracted settlers to Ponyville after the Smith family first settled there, and that zap apple jam was the very first thing that Diamond Tiara's great grandfather Stinkin' Rich ever sold.

"Baby Cakes","Charlotte Fullerton","2012-01-14","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Baby_Cakes"," is the thirteenth   of the second season of   and the thirty-ninth episode overall.   babysits the newborn   of  , but she finds that the task is much harder than she initially expected.   This episode is listed as number twelve on  's episode guide.     The episode starts with  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   looking down on the newborn baby nursery of the   Hospital. Mr. Cake shows his new Pegasus son, Pound Cake, and his new unicorn daughter, Pumpkin Cake. Pinkie Pie goes into the nursery to start celebrating, but is soon reprimanded by   several times to be quiet so she doesn't wake up the other babies (eventually to the point of being kicked out of the nursery). After Applejack asks how Pound Cake is a   and Pumpkin Cake is a  , Mr. Cake explains why he has unicorn and Pegasus children even when he and Mrs. Cake are   by saying that distant relatives of theirs were Pegasi and unicorns.   A month later, Pinkie Pie brings the babies a one-month celebratory cake and  . After singing to the babies and popping out of their cake, she plays peek-a-boo with them. Shortly after that, Mr. Cake changes their diapers, and Mrs. Cake brings them their bottles to feed them. After Mr. Cake burps the babies, they both run off to play with Pinkie again.   After being reminded about food, Mrs. Cake remembers a large catering order to complete. However, they need a babysitter. They ignore Pinkie Pie's requesting to babysit, and begin their search by asking Fluttershy. However, Fluttershy declines, saying she promised to go on a picnic with  . They then ask Twilight, who also declines because she is busy summarizing her reports to send to  . Applejack declines because she is too busy saving her apples from a swarm of ravenous caterpillars. Rainbow Dash declines because she has tickets to   air show. When Mr. and Mrs. Cake ask Rarity, however, she simply refuses with no given reason to her decline. Finally, they oblige to let Pinkie Pie babysit their children.   The Cakes leave Pinkie Pie a big list of what she needs to do. After they leave, Pinkie Pie is immediately left with two crying babies to deal with. She tries to cheer them up with some more peek-a-boo, and pulling a face. She then begins a pseudo-standup comedy show, and begins telling jokes. While this seems to calm them down to begin with, they start crying at Pinkie's second joke. Pinkie Pie resorts to   and dancing around her stage, but this has no effect as the babies begin crying during the song. Falling over, Pinkie Pie accidentally knocks a bag of flour off the top of the refrigerator, which empties on her. This manages to make the babies laugh.   At snack time, Pinkie Pie brings the babies their prepared meals, only for Pumpkin Cake to start eating the tablecloth and for Pound Cake to end up with food on his head. Pinkie Pie then tries to give the two babies a bath, and has trouble to get them into the tub. Once they are in the tub, she manages to keep them shortly entertained by blowing bubbles with the soap. This is short-lived, since they start crying again after she buries them in tub toys. After they get Pinkie wet, she brings in another bag of flour but begs them not to make her use it. The Cake twins continue crying, forcing Pinkie to dump the flour over her wet body, turning it into dough. Pinkie Pie then needs to change the babies' diapers after noticing the smell. After cornering and wrestling with the twins, she ends up with the two diapers on her instead. Twilight then arrives and offers help to Pinkie Pie, who is more than happy to accept. However, Twilight then says that she expected that Pinkie would need help, and implies that Pinkie Pie is not cut out to handle the workload and responsibilities of babies. Feeling insulted, Pinkie Pie tersely thanks Twilight for dropping by, pushes her out the door, and shuts it in her face. Pinkie huffs behind the door that Twilight would think that she can't handle the situation on her own, but then she admits that perhaps that's because she   experienced this situation before. She resolves to do so, and on her own.   Determined to prove that she is a responsible pony, Pinkie Pie begins to be assertive and stops Pound Cake jumping on his crib and Pumpkin Cake from chewing on a toy. Setting Pumpkin Cake beside her brother in his crib, Pinkie tells the babies that it's time for their naps and to go to sleep, and unexpectedly, they comply immediately and fall asleep. Tucking them in, raising the safety rail and tossing the toy into the closet, Pinkie Pie leaves the room, but when she turns around to close the door, she sees that they have disappeared. She immediately starts to search for them, and quickly finds Pumpkin Cake chewing on the toy in the closet. She is shocked to find Pound Cake walking on the ceiling using his wings. Pinkie uses suction cup boots to get Pound Cake down, but is then utterly flabbergasted to witness Pumpkin Cake using her magic to move a bunch of toys from her crib to chew on. When Pinkie Pie puts these away, using a chain and padlock on the toybox for good measure, she grabs on to Pound Cake to stop him flying around, but she ends up getting dragged around down to the kitchen and storefront, knocking over all sorts of baked goods before being dragged back upstairs. Pumpkin Cake then figures out how to levitate herself. Now faced with   flying foals, Pinkie traps them under a play pen and tapes it to the floor, only for Pumpkin Cake to make the side intangible to walk through, while Pound Cake flies upward to break the tape. Pumpkin Cake uses her telekinesis to break the padlock and promptly chews on a toy while Pound Cake zooms around the room.    Frazzled, stressed out, and feeling completely overwhelmed, Pinkie Pie bursts into tears. The twins feel bad of what they did and manage to cheer Pinkie Pie up by telekinetically covering themselves in flour. After that, she manages to get the twins to fall asleep in Pumpkin Cake's crib.    Pinkie Pie writes a   to Princess Celestia, saying that being a caregiver means more responsibility than just being a playmate, and that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it. After cleaning everything up, Mr. and Mrs. Cake return home. Expecting the place to be a mess, they are astounded by the immaculate condition of their home, and praise Pinkie Pie for her unexpected level of responsibility. They ask her if she wants to be their permanent babysitter, but Pinkie Pie turns them down, saying that she ""should be available a week from... never!"" But once she hears the twins utter her name as they sleep, she has a change of heart and says she has some free time next Tuesday.      "

Many   assets from   are reused, including the four train pulling ponies, who pull the coach Applejack commandeers. On November 8, 2015, episode writer   posted a scene from the first draft of the script on Twitter that was cut from the final episode. The scene involves Applejack reluctantly accepting a saddle from Rarity before she leaves for the Canterlot Rodeo.   Shortly after airing, some viewers complained that  's portrayal was offensive to mentally disabled persons and contradicted the show's lessons about friendship. Amy Keating Rogers responded with a statement which was republished on Equestria Daily.  According to Rogers, Derpy's scene was originally longer and included a flashback that showed how town hall was damaged; when Derpy was removing lightning from thunderclouds, she ""bucked bolts"" too close to the building. Rogers intended this clumsy pony to be called Ditzy Doo as a reference to the episode  , but was asked to name her Derpy as a ""tip of the hat"" to the fans. The episode was removed from rotation and iTunes due to complaints about Derpy's portrayal, and was later put back up, after Derpy's voice and eyes had been changed, and the mention of her name removed. The original version of the episode is retained in   DVD, but reruns on   and the one on the Season 2 box set are the altered version.   in Canada also airs the altered version. The streaming company   has the edited version, although subtitles on the system retain the original dialogue and, therefore, the use of ""Derpy"".   only airs the edited version; dub director   only dubbed the edited version.     watches her sister,  , jump over hurdles and shot put a bale of hay in a practice obstacle course. Apple Bloom is confident that her sister will win the   Rodeo Competition. When Applejack responds modestly, Apple Bloom says that she is the ten-time rodeo champion of   and holds more blue ribbons than any pony in town. The filly says that she can't wait for her sister ""to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champion!”     Outside Ponyville’s  ,   tries to help   set up a banner but ends up wrecking a part of the building.

In turn, Applejack thanks the citizens for supporting her in every rodeo ever since she was little. She promises to make Ponyville proud and the crowd cheers. The scene cuts to the   and friends saying goodbye to Applejack on the train platform.    A week later, Applejack’s friends and family are waiting for Applejack to come home to a surprise party in the   barn. However, a mailpony shows up to deliver a letter from Applejack. Amazed, the mailpony asks, ""How did you know it was my birthday?"" In the letter, Applejack says that she will send the prize money but will not be returning to Ponyville. Saddened by the news,  , Rainbow Dash,  ,  , and   assure the Apple family that they will go to the rodeo to ask Applejack why she won't be coming back. The friends also tell a crying   that they will search all of Equestria for Applejack if they must.

After they disembark, Pinkie Pie inadvertently finds Applejack in a nearby restroom. Applejack explains that she has been working at a cherry farm run by a pony called  . Cherry Jubilee shows up and recounts how Applejack was looking for ""a change of scenery.” Applejack asks her friends to go home without her and tell her family that she's doing fine. The friends believe that Applejack is not telling the whole truth.   In the factory, Applejack uses a treadmill to power a conveyor belt transporting yellow and red cherries. Applejack frowns when her friends are hired to be red/yellow cherry sorters. Twilight takes the opportunity to ask Applejack what she thought of Canterlot and the rodeo. Rainbow Dash joins in, asking if she saw   and  . Rarity also leaves her post and inquires how Applejack met Miss Jubilee. Applejack curtly responds that she befriended Miss Jubilee at her cherry stand at the rodeo. Applejack becomes irritated by her friends’ incessant questions and moves the conveyor belt too fast for Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie. In an attempt to handle the onslaught of cherries, Pinkie Pie stuffs their saddlebags and then her own mouth with cherries. Fluttershy cries "" !"" and Applejack skids to a halt. The cherries fly off the conveyor belt and cover Applejack with cherry juice. The five friends are then seen mopping up the juice on the floor and walls. Calling for drastic measures, Rainbow Dash says it's time to ""call in the big guns,"" and the camera dramatically zooms in on Pinkie Pie.    When Applejack is bucking cherry trees, Pinkie Pie asks her if she needs some help, promising to not ask any questions. Pinkie Pie starts babbling about cherry-based dishes and fun things to say, such as ""chimicherry,"" ""cherrychanga,"" ""kumquat,"" and ""pickle barrel."" Overwhelmed, Applejack begs her to stop. Rainbow Dash, who is wearing earplugs, tells Applejack that the only way she can stop the madness is to spill the beans. Applejack finally agrees to tell the truth tomorrow at breakfast, and when Pinkie doubts her, she gives a  .   The next morning, the five go to Applejack's bedroom, but nobody is there. Pinkie Pie is enraged because Applejack broke her Pinkie promise. Meanwhile, Applejack is waiting at the Dodge Junction train station with her luggage. When she sees her friends running towards her, she jumps on a coach and orders the four ponies pulling the coach to run away. The friends start chasing Applejack in a cart pulled by Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy. Just as they are approaching Applejack, Fluttershy suddenly comes to a halt to avoid hitting a rabbit. When they catch up to Applejack again, Pinkie Pie leaps into her coach to ask why she broke her Pinkie promise, but Applejack insists that she didn’t break the promise because she did not go to breakfast. Pinkie Pie accepts her excuse and jumps backwards into the wooden cart, saying, ""Rarity, catch me."" Taken aback, Rarity is knocked off the cart, and both of them tumble off. Twilight tells the Pegasi to go back, but Rainbow Dash refuses. The ponies see a train hurtling down a railroad track stretching across their path. The coach ponies doubtfully look at Applejack, but she whips them, and their coach crosses the track, narrowly avoiding the oncoming train. Applejack jumps off and says, ""Yee-haw!"", but the coach ponies say, ""Lady, you're trouble,"" before driving away.   Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash fly over the train, and Rainbow Dash tackles Applejack upon landing. A bunch of medals spill out of Applejack's bag and Twilight compliments Applejack, but she despairs because she didn’t win a single blue ribbon nor any prize money. She explains that she tried to earn money on the cherry farm so she could send home the money she promised. Twilight contradicts Applejack's belief that she is a failure and Rainbow Dash says that as friends, they wouldn't care even if she came in fiftieth place. Fluttershy chips in, saying that the hole in town hall can always be repaired but not the hole in their hearts if Applejack never comes back. Rainbow Dash quietly cries and says, ""Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!""   Applejack learns that there is no reason to hide when you don’t do as well as you had hoped. Instead of running away from your problems, you should turn to your friends and family.  When Applejack comes off the train in Ponyville, her family and   hug her. The episode ends when Rarity and Pinkie Pie, who were left behind during the chase, use a hoof-powered railroad cart to travel home. Pinkie Pie still compares the words ""chimicherry"" and ""cherrychanga,"" and Rarity mutters that Rainbow Dash will get it when they return.      "
"The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000","M. A. Larson","2012-01-28","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/The_Super_Speedy_Cider_Squeezy_6000"," is the fifteenth   of the second season of   and the forty-first episode overall. In this episode, the   challenge the   to a cider-making competition. The story is a homage to   vs. the Steam Drill, an old fable about manpower beating machine.   According to Steffan Andrews, who orchestrated  ,  ""Cider Horse Rules"" was a working title for this episode.  This episode did not originally have a  , and   was surprised that the ""lesson"" he wrote was approved. Hasbro produced a   of the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 machine, which includes a figure of Flim.      The episode opens with a shot of   sleeping. She is soon awoken by  , who drags her to   in order to be there early for the opening day of cider season. Dash complains that   is always first in line and always buys an unfairly large amount of cider. She says that this time she intends to beat Pinkie to the head of the line by lining up before dawn. As they arrive, however, they see a massive queue of ponies camping out to get cider and Dash worries that there won't be enough for her. They meet up with Pinkie Pie, who is once again first in line. She says that she ""had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out,"" and she, ""told a few others about it and they all thought it was a great idea too.""   then announces that cider season is open and   begins to serve draught apple cider to   individually as they come down the queue, while   receives payment. Pinkie Pie buys not just one mug of cider but a whole trays' worth. As the serving goes on, the barrels of cider left for   to tap decrease, and Fluttershy, who is just one place in front of Rainbow Dash, gets the last mug of cider for the day. Extremely upset by this, Rainbow Dash and the other ponies who didn't get cider begin to complain. Applejack explains that there will be more cider tomorrow, and that while they always manage to improve production every year, the   recipe is made with love and care and can't be rushed. The crowd, however, is still angry and complains that the Apples always run out of cider before everyone is served.   Amidst the chaos, the   arrive in their large vehicle, which they later reveal to be named the ""Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000."" They kick off a long   as soon as they arrive, and sing about their production of cider. Managing to entice the entire crowd into joining in their song, they quickly make themselves popular. They use this popularity to their advantage. With  's citizens faced with the dilemma of a limited quantity of manually pressed cider, they turn to the Flim Flam brothers and their automated cider production. Upset by the arrival of the Flim Flam brothers and the threat of automated production running them out of business, the Apple family tells them that their hoofmade cider will never be outshone by anything automatic.   The twin brothers attempt to broker a deal with the Apple family, who will supply them with their delicious apples, and they will sell the cider under the Flim Flam brothers name. They call for a 75-25 split in profits in their favor. Applejack reminds the others that their cider profits keep the family business afloat during the winter months; if they were to accept, they would lose the farm. The Apple family declines the offer, which prompts Flim to state that if the Apple family refuses to partner up with the brothers, they will run the family out of business and out of Ponyville.   The next day, cider season is in full kick again. The Flim Flam brothers once again arrive after the cider has run out and attempt to sell their own cider. However, Applejack lassos a barrel of their cider away, saying they can't sell cider made from Apple family apples. Rainbow Dash, about to drink her glass of cider, has it knocked away by the barrel. She ends up eating the dirt it spills over into. Hearing Applejack say that the Flim Flam brothers can't sell their cider, Rainbow asks if Applejack is playing a ""cruel joke"" on her.  With the Apple family confident that their hoof-made cider will always be better than the Flim Flam brothers' automatically produced cider, the Flim Flam brothers challenge them to a duel of who can produce the most barrels of cider in one hour. Reluctant at first, Granny Smith tells them they won't compete. However, after being called chicken, she agrees to a competition.    The two parties meet up at Sweet Apple Acres. The   and   kick off the competition, and the two teams begin their work. For the Flim Flam brothers, it's as easy as pressing a button. However, the Apple family immediately gets into the task, with Applejack bucking trees, Apple Bloom collecting the apples, Granny Smith sorting them, and Big McIntosh running the treadmill press and casking the cider.  Inevitably, the Flim Flam brothers' automated production line far outpaces the manual production of the Apple Family by three barrels to one. Fortunately, Applejack's friends arrive, naming themselves honorary family members and asking the mayor if they can participate in the event. Mayor asks the Flim Flam brothers if they care, and after they say they don't since they'll win anyway, she lets Applejack's friends participate.   assigns her friends their tasks. Fluttershy helps Applejack with picking by zipping among the branches and shaking the entire crown, while the acrobatic Pinkie Pie helps Apple Bloom with collection. With her eye for detail,   helps Granny Smith with sorting. Rainbow Dash uses her energy and stamina alongside Big McIntosh to power the press, and Twilight takes over for Big Mac with casking. With the added help, Apple Family cider production begins to increase: as she casks and stacks with her telekinesis, Twilight calculates they're helping to make five barrels in the same time the Apples were making one by themselves. Noticing the massive increase in production from the Apple Family, the Flim Flam brothers override their automatic apple quality control, and increase the power of the apple vacuum. This leads to whole trees being taken in which results in stalks, branches, rotten apples, and even rocks making their way into their cider. At the end of the hour, the Flim Flam brothers have won due to their larger amount of cider produced. This makes the large audience of Ponyville residents, as well as the Apple family and honorary family members, visibly upset. But Applejack stays true to her word and tells the Flim Flam brothers that they won fair and square, and they set off to move away from Sweet Apple Acres.   The Flim Flam brothers begin their sale of cider. They dish out their first few mugs of cider which are unfortunately laced with branches, leaves, rocks and rotten apples, and in return get it spat back at them. The angry crowd of Ponyville's residents say that they refuse to pay for the Flim Flam brothers' low quality cider, and without a second thought, the two brothers make a quick escape from Ponyville. This allows Applejack to begin selling the family's cider again, and because she, her friends and her family have made so many barrels, they have enough for everyone in Ponyville.   Applejack begins to send a   to   about what she had learned, but she cuts it off after saying she didn't learn anything and was right after all: "" ."" She adds that she could say she's learned that her friends will always back her up in a crisis but that she already knew that, too. Rainbow Dash attempts to get cider, but they run out again, causing her to nearly burst into tears. Pinkie Pie offers her a mug, and the Mane Six raise their mugs in cheers.     "
"Read It and Weep","Cindy Morrow","2012-02-04","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Read_It_and_Weep"," is the sixteenth   of the second season of   and the forty-second episode overall. While   is stuck in the hospital with an injured wing, she discovers the joy of reading but hides it from her friends due to her former penchant of mocking it as an ""egghead"" pursuit.   The episode was storyboarded by Raven M. Molisee and Dave Wiebe. Molisee stated that the working title for the episode was "" "", which is the name of the classic PBS children's educational television series. Writer   said that the episode had other suggested working titles besides ""Reading Rainbow"", such as ""A Dash of Fiction"", ""Speed Reader"",  ""A Need for Read"", ""Book Before You Leap"", and ""Every Trick in the Book"".  She also referred to the episode as ""Read'em and Weep"". This episode was nominated for a 2012   for ""Best Overall Sound in an Animation Program or Series"".    The episode begins with   and   watching something zip about in the sky.   joins them and asks what they're looking at. Pinkie tells her that they're watching  , who's performing a series of aerial stunts. Rarity and Pinkie remark how dazzling Rainbow Dash is, and the three watch her in admiration. However, something appears to go wrong, and the   watch in horror as Dash plummets to the ground.   Rainbow Dash regains consciousness in a hospital bed with her friends standing around her. She finds that her right wing is bandaged and groans.   tells Twilight that Rainbow Dash is going to be fine, but that she will need to be in the hospital for a few days, to which Dash voices her frustration. Her friends try to cheer her up, but Dash can only sulk under the bed sheets. Twilight notices a nurse walking by with a cart of books and brings one,  , over to Dash. Rainbow Dash immediately and rudely tosses the book away, saying that reading is ""for eggheads"" and ""uncool"". Her friends chuckle at her view of reading, saying that everyone enjoys reading from time to time. The nurse walks in and tells the ponies that they'll have to come back tomorrow. Just before leaving, Twilight tells Rainbow Dash that she'd like Daring Do and the two of them are a lot alike.    Following a shot of a clock on the wall showing that it's one o'clock, Rainbow Dash makes several attempts to pass the time—bouncing a ball off the wall, having her lunch (getting a glass briefly stuck on her muzzle), turning her bedside lamp on and off, and telling jokes to  . A bored-looking Rainbow Dash glances up to the clock and groans loudly as it turns to one minute past one. Rainbow Dash looks to the book on her nightstand. She refuses to pick it up at first, but after a couple more reluctant peeks, she sighs in surrender and picks it up to start reading. As she reads, Dash finds herself instantly identifying with the main character, who also has an injured wing.   Rainbow Dash continues reading the book aloud, and the scene fades to the events told within, where  , a brown-coated, grey-maned   with the same mane style as Rainbow Dash herself, makes her way through a tropical jungle and finds herself surrounded by a tiger, a black panther, a lynx, a cheetah, and a white house cat. Daring flees from the wildcats and uses a vine to swing across a chasm. Rainbow Dash's narration returns, and she reads that Daring Do finds herself in front of the ancient temple that she'd been seeking. The scene cuts back to Rainbow Dash, who comes to grips with the fact that she loves the book (  reading) and that she is now an egghead.    Following another passage of the book, in which Daring Do braves the ancient temple's numerous traps and pitfalls, a knock at the door interrupts Rainbow Dash. She quickly hides the book under the covers as Twilight and   enter the room. They come to help Rainbow Dash with her boredom with a  -style game, which Dash purposely loses and quickly puts away. Before the two can question Dash's odd behavior, she chases them out with the pretense of trying to sleep. When they leave, Dash retrieves the book and continues reading. Daring Do makes her way past more obstacles and comes to the Sapphire Stone. After briefly surveying the area around it, she picks it up and tucks it under her hat. This sets off a trap that causes the chamber to start collapsing and filling with lava. Daring Do jumps from the collapsing pillars and escapes the chamber through a skylight, but a gust of air from the chamber blasts her clear into the jungle, where she falls right at the feet of a strange dog-like creature. The creature cheerfully says ""hello, Rainbow Dash"" with Pinkie Pie's voice, and the story shifts back to Rainbow Dash's hospital room.   Pinkie Pie,  , and Rarity enter the room and inquire about Dash's well being.   then enters with Dash's dinner, which Dash eats messily, and her friends bid an awkward goodbye and leave the room in disgust. Rainbow Dash spits out the food and picks up the book again. The dog-like creature named   captures Daring Do and ties her to a stone table in another booby-trapped room, then sets off the traps and leaves. Spiked walls start closing in, spiders crawl over the spikes, cobras emerge from the mouth of an ornament on the wall, and quicksand starts filling the room. The story is once again interrupted, this time by Doctor Horse—who informs her that she's to be discharged from the hospital, and the nurses hastily wheel her out the front door before she can finish the book.    Rainbow Dash despairs that she'll never find out what happens to Daring Do. She remembers that Twilight has a copy of the book, but after having called her an egghead, she despairs even more. Rainbow Dash attempts to admit herself into the hospital again by faking an injury. Doctor Horse doesn't fall for the ruse, however, so Rainbow Dash sneaks into the hospital at night. Rainbow Dash returns to the room she was staying in and sees a new patient occupying the bed. Underneath the bed, she finds the book. She continues reading immediately, but she ends up waking the patient and alerting the hospital staff. As Rainbow Dash makes her getaway, her wing cramps up mid-flight and she crashes, causing her to lose the book. Before she can recover it, the hospital staff chase her out of the hospital and through  .   The noisy pursuit wakes Rainbow Dash's friends from their sleep, and all parties meet in front of the  . When asked what's going on, Dash admits to being an egghead and explains that she liked the book Twilight gave her, and she tried stealing it from the hospital so she could finish reading it. Understanding of her plight, Dash's friends tell her she didn't need to make a ruckus—or, as Pinkie puts it, a fracas—over a book. Twilight lets Rainbow Dash borrow her copy of the book, and Rainbow apologizes for everything that's happened. Twilight explains that reading is something everyone can enjoy if they give it a try, and Rainbow Dash learns not to knock something until she's tried it.    The scene shifts back to the Daring Do story. Overcome by the quicksand, Daring Do flings her hat off of her hoof; it bounces off the walls and ceiling before hitting the trap lever to its original position. The walls and the quicksand recede, and a door opens leading outside. The scene cuts to Ahuizotl petting the white house-cat and gloating over his victory. Suddenly, Daring Do swings down from a vine and snatches the Sapphire Statue right out of his hand. As Ahuizotl weeps over his defeat, Daring Do gallops off. Rainbow Dash finishes reading the book in her bedroom and delightedly picks up another book,  .       "

Therefore, the Crusaders take action to find her one. In  , the Crusaders look for the ideal stallion for their teacher, but their initial candidates are either unsuitable or already have special someponies. When they spot   piling haystacks, they eagerly ask if he has plans for Hearts and Hooves Day, and when he answers no, they decide he and Cheerilee are right for each other.   suggests that since Big Mac is so shy, it will be up to Cheerilee to ask him. The Crusaders set up a romantic picnic, and lure Cheerilee there by asking her to identify a tree near the gazebo. Big McIntosh arrives with a toolbox to fix the gazebo, but the three fillies have already fixed it. The fillies quickly hide in a bush to spy on the couple as they awkwardly chat. They are excited when Cheerilee appears to be leaning in for a kiss, but she matter-of-factly points out that Big Mac has something stuck in his teeth.    Dejected that they were unable to help Cheerilee and McIntosh get together, the Crusaders bump into  , who is reading a book about Hearts and Hooves Day. According to the book, the tradition started because of a love potion. The interested Cutie Mark Crusaders ask to borrow the book, and Twilight lends it to them. She tries to bestow another book, but the excited fillies have already left. The Cutie Mark Crusaders immediately rush to their clubhouse to create the love potion using ""a tuft of cloud"" and ""a bright rainbow's glow."" The book then instructs to stir the mixture with a Pegasus feather. The potions turns bright pink and emits heart-shaped bubbles. Later that day, they bring Cheerilee and Big Mac together once more to test the potion, telling them it is punch they made. While they hide in the bushes, Cheerilee finally realizes the fillies' plan to bring them together and tells Big Mac to play along and try the ""punch."" They drink it and the potion quickly takes effect. Cheerilee asks the stallion to be her ""very special somepony,"" and he accepts. The girls are thrilled until they hear the couple calling each other pet names, such as ""shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie"" and ""cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny."" Disgusted by this strange level of love, the Crusaders wonder what's gone wrong.

The Crusaders go to  , where Cheerilee and Big Mac are lovingly sharing a milkshake.   mentions that two ponies so clearly in love will probably want to plan a wedding soon. Sweetie Belle decides that if they can keep the two love-struck ponies away long enough to ""get ready"" for a wedding, the spell will wear off. The Crusaders suggest a wedding to Cheerilee and Big Mac, who are excited by the prospect and rush off to prepare for one.   Sweetie Belle helps Cheerilee select a wedding dress at   while barricading the dressing room to keep her inside. At the jewelry shop, Apple Bloom helps Big Mac select a diamond ring, as   keeps track of how much time remains until the spell is broken. When Apple Bloom is talking to Scootaloo, Big Mac quickly purchases a diamond for Cheerilee and hurries to Carousel Boutique. Apple Bloom asks Scootaloo to hurry and warn Sweetie Belle, while she attempts to slow down Big Mac. However, the determined stallion is too strong to be stopped. Being weighed down by oxen and a cart full of anvils fails to stop him, and even being tethered to a house only slows him down. As Big Mac approaches the boutique, he falls into a large pit in the ground dug by Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo and lands on a mattress at the bottom. At the same time, Cheerilee bursts out of the barricaded boutique and runs towards her love. The town clock rings the hour mark just as Cheerilee jumps in, and the spell is broken. Cheerilee has no idea why she looks like she is about to get married at the bottom of a pit, and Big Mac returns to his normal, taciturn self. The Crusaders explain that it was all because of their selfish motives to make them fall in love with each other, and they apologize for the ordeal. Cheerilee and Big Mac decide that a fair punishment would be for the fillies to do all of Big Mac's chores. With the free time that Big Mac now has, he and Cheerilee decide to have lunch together at the gazebo, calling each other ""sugar bear"" and ""pumpkin pie"" and teasingly winking at each other behind the fillies' backs.

This episode had the most   within an episode, until its successor   surpassed it with seven songs.   In October 2011 showrunner and supervising director   shared two cryptic photographs of the stop-motion setup with his Twitter followers, which later became the scene through  's imagination animated in felt.  The scene was originally intended to be animated the same way as the rest of the series.  The shapes were cut out by Thiessen's wife Jocelan, and animated by Thiessen himself in their basement.

Twilight and  , who is reading a   book, explain that she just has to accept that Cranky wants to be left alone. Pinkie agrees and decides to leave him alone, but only after he accepts her apology. As she tries to apologize, Cranky flees her. She chases him around town trying everything to get him to accept her apology, but he refuses, saying that nothing she can do can replace the book, which was his only reminder of 'her'.    As Pinkie leaves in defeat, she is suddenly struck with an idea. Speaking through the door, Pinkie tells Cranky that there is still one more thing she wants to give him. He turns her down stubbornly, but after hearing a different voice in reply, he opens the door to see  , the donkey Pinkie had greeted previously who turned out to be the special friend Cranky had been looking for. Pinkie explains that she figured it out from the items in Cranky's scrapbook: a flower, a ticket, and a menu from the  , items she had also seen in a scrapbook owned by Matilda. Cranky reveals the story of meeting Matilda at the Gala. According to his story, he discovered that Matilda had disappeared when he entered her room the next day, and leaves without reading the note that Matilda had left behind. He then spent his life searching for her, and came to Ponyville to retire from his search. Matilda tells him that she has been living in Ponyville the whole time. They reunite and Matilda kisses him on the nose, causing Cranky to smile for the first time in years. Cranky gladly accepts Pinkie's apology and finally accepts her friendship. Pinkie literally turns into a rocket and explodes with joy, bouncing about rambling about everything she and Cranky can do together as friends. She calms down as Cranky tells her that he and Matilda just want some time to be together, but he assures Pinkie that the two of them are indeed friends.   As Pinkie leaves, she muses on her   to  : While some friends may enjoy playing and laughing together, some may just like to be left alone, which is fine too. Whatever the case, one of the best things about friendship is being able to make one's friends smile.

Fed up with being pushed around and ignored,   takes a class on assertiveness taught by  . However, instead of just becoming more assertive, she becomes bossy, pushy and mean, threatening to end her friendship with   and  .   The storyboard artists had professional wrestler   in mind when posing Iron Will,  who uses hand gestures that mimic Hogan's signature taunts.

All of the pets eat eagerly except for  , who refuses anything Fluttershy attempts to serve him. When Fluttershy asks him what he   eat, he presents her with a recipe for an elaborate cherry-topped salad. She protests, but Angel slaps her and shoves the recipe in her face, and she yields. In the   market, Fluttershy tries to buy asparagus from a stall, but other ponies cut in front of her. Meek as she is, Fluttershy is unable to assert herself.   and   see her predicament and try to teach her how to stand up for herself. Rarity uses her charm and sweet talk to buy the last bundle of asparagus from  , and Pinkie Pie tricks a tomato stall owner into selling her tomatoes at half the asked price.   Fluttershy attempts to use these methods to buy the last cherry in the market, but it backfires on her, and she ends up losing the cherry to  . Fluttershy returns to her   and serves the salad to Angel, apologizing for the lack of the cherry on top. Upset by this, Angel tosses both the salad   Fluttershy out the door, causing Fluttershy to crash head-first into her postbox. As she laments her being ""a doormat"", she finds a pamphlet for an assertiveness seminar.    Fluttershy arrives at the hedge maze where the seminar is being held (tossed to the back of the crowd when she tries to squeeze into the front row). The seminar begins, and a muscular Minotaur named   dramatically appears on stage to greet the crowd of ponies. He promises that anyone who follows his advice and techniques will no longer be a pushover, even providing a 100% satisfaction guarantee – anyone who isn't fully satisfied with his training will pay   for the seminar. Iron Will calls for a volunteer to demonstrate his methods, and his goat assistants pick out Fluttershy. When Fluttershy timidly walks on stage, one of the goat assistants deliberately blocks her path, at which point Iron Will delivers his first lessons (in rhyme form). Fluttershy hesitantly takes these lessons to heart and gives it a try; Iron Will is impressed and pleased, anticipating a big payday. He announces to the crowd that if his techniques can work for a shy pony like Fluttershy, then they can work for anyone. Fluttershy hears the audience cheering and smiles.   At her cottage, Fluttershy is ready to ""attack the day"" with a new, confident attitude. The advice given to her by Iron Will helps her stand up to   when he over-waters her plants and   and   when they block her path with garbage carts.   She even asserts herself when she's yet again cut in line at  , scaring   and a handful of other ponies into moving behind her. Rarity and Pinkie Pie remark how impressed they are with ""new Fluttershy"". However, when Pinkie Pie makes a joke and starts laughing, Fluttershy takes the laughter as an insult and spills punch on her before happily leaving the bakery. She then hails a taxi, but   hops into it before her. She promptly attacks and throws him from the cart, leaving a thoroughly worried Rarity and Pinkie Pie behind.   Fluttershy leaves her cottage once more with more confidence than ever. Realizing the wrong mail has been left in her postbox, she confronts the mailpony and disregards his apologies, citing Iron Will's lessons again. Moments later, the tourist   asks her for directions to the Ponyville Tower. As she responds, she ends up dropping her mail in a puddle. Fluttershy explodes in anger and throws Globe Trotter across the field and into a bale of hay. Rarity and Pinkie Pie confront Fluttershy, worried about her recent behavior. Taking their concern as an affront, Fluttershy belittles and insults the two – Pinkie for her ""simple little brain"" and Rarity's pettiness – causing them to run away in tears. When Fluttershy calms down and sees her reflection in a puddle. Realizing how violent and unkind she's been acting, she breaks down, remorseful.   Some time later, Rarity and Pinkie Pie come to Fluttershy's cottage and find the doors and windows boarded up. They knock on the door and call out to Fluttershy, but Fluttershy tells them to go away before she hurts them again. Inside, as Angel ties her to a chair, Fluttershy vows to never come out of her house again to avoid causing any more misery to her friends. Pinkie Pie and Rarity try to talk to her, placing blame for her actions on Iron Will's advice, and tell her she can stand up for herself without being mean, but Fluttershy thinks she's gone too far with her assertiveness.   Before they can talk further, Iron Will arrives to collect payment from Fluttershy after hearing news of her transformation. Rarity and Pinkie Pie attempt to charm and trick him into leaving, using the same methods they demonstrated in the marketplace, but Iron Will won't be turned away. When he knocks at Fluttershy's door and she answers, he demands his payment, but she flatly and calmly refuses, surprising Rarity and Pinkie Pie. This angers the Minotaur, but Fluttershy reminds him of his 100% satisfaction guarantee; informing him that she isn't satisfied because his teachings caused her to be mean to everypony and drive her friends away, and therefore she won't pay. Surprised by this, Iron Will tries to cut her a deal, but she firmly declines, saying ""no means no"". Unable to persuade her at all, and proving to be a minotaur of his word, Iron Will honors his agreement and leaves, remarking that he may use ""no means no"" in his next seminar. Rarity and Pinkie Pie congratulate Fluttershy for standing up to Iron Will. The three friends reconcile and hug, happy that ""old Fluttershy"" has returned and that ""new Fluttershy"" is no more.    In her   to  , Fluttershy explains that she's learned it's possible to stand up for yourself without changing who you are.

"It's About Time","M. A. Larson","2012-03-10","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/It%27s_About_Time"," is the twentieth   of the second season of   and the forty-sixth episode overall. In this episode, after receiving a warning from her future self,   drives herself crazy in an attempt to avoid an unspecified upcoming catastrophic disaster.    The episode begins with   in a dream sequence where he is showing   around a mysterious land of ice cream. He shows her his house, made of ice cream and ""extra chocolate fudge"". He then wakes up at 3 AM and sees   pacing downstairs in the   lobby, worrying about herself running out of time in this month's schedule to make a new schedule.    Twilight remains awake writing out her schedule until dawn. As she finishes, a bright light appears on the other side of the lobby. Another Twilight appears out of the bright light, with a messy mane, tattered black suit with an eyepatch and bandage, and a scar on her face. Twilight is initially shocked, since meeting another her is ""not scientifically possible."" The other Twilight explains that she is from the future. Present Twilight asks how she figured out how to time travel, to which she responds by stating that the spell is in the   wing of the   Castle. Unfortunately, due to Twilight's intense curiosity about time travel, Future Twilight is unable to get a word in edgewise and doesn't have enough time to warn her of what will happen ""next Tuesday"", which is when she is from. She vanishes back into the future just mere seconds before she is able to convey her warning. The present Twilight assumes that because Future Twilight looked as bad as she did, she was going to warn Twilight about some kind of horrible disaster and determines that she has to find out what it is and prevent it.   The next scene shows   and   carrying party goods through  . Pinkie is floating with a bunch of balloons, whereas Fluttershy is carrying everything else on her back. Twilight slams into Fluttershy as she runs through Ponyville to warn everyone of an incident she believes will happen next Tuesday. Wearing a Groucho Marx disguise she accidentally puts on after crashing into Fluttershy, Twilight jumps onto a platform and warns a small group of Ponyville residents of the incident. They proceed to laugh at her twice - once because of her disguise, and again because of her ludicrous story that she saw herself from the future. Twilight's friends, however, believe her story, so Twilight thinks up a plan to try prevent the disaster. She tells the   to search all over   looking for potential disasters, and they do so. She instructs the remainder of Ponyville's residents to ""disaster-proof Equestria"". Twilight oversees the entire operation, checking off items on her list as they are completed, including maintaining the dam, filling in wall cracks inside the library, topping off a water tower, reinforcing a bridge, and giving Pinkie Pie a haircut.   Suddenly,   arrives from   out of nowhere and scares everyone but Spike and Twilight away. Twilight assumes that this was the disaster Future Twilight wanted to warn her about and prepares to stop Cerberus. Before she can do so, however, Fluttershy intervenes and soothes Cerberus by rubbing its belly. On being asked by Twilight for a ball, Pinkie Pie pulls one out of a tree knot, stating that she stocks balls all over Ponyville in case of a ""ball emergency"". She gives it to Twilight, who then uses it to lure Cerberus back to Tartarus. When Twilight returns the next morning, she's covered in soot. Spike suddenly belches a ""lost dog"" poster, noting that   hadn't heard about Cerberus being returned. However, the scroll hits Twilight in the face and gives her a paper cut on her cheek. When she sees this cut in the mirror, she notices that it's exactly the same cut on Future Twilight's cheek, and realizes that her efforts to ""disaster-proof"" everything have not worked.   Twilight continues to pace around the lobby, gouging a deep, circular groove in the floor in the process. She reasons that if she stays still, nothing could possibly happen to her, and thus the disaster will not happen. Spike begins to take advantage of Twilight standing still by taking tubs of ice cream and eating them, deciding that the resultant stomach ache will be his future self's problem. Then,   enters, stating that a Pegasus just came back from "" "" with an all-clear. She asks why Twilight isn't stopping Spike from gorging himself on ice cream, to which Spike replies that she won't because she is standing still until next Tuesday. They both begin laughing at Twilight, and Spike begins tickling her with a feather. This culminates in Twilight using magic to catapult Spike away, which in turn results in Spike being flung into a wall and belching up a fireball which hits Twilight. The flame messes up Twilight's mane, causing it to look exactly like Future Twilight's mane. Twilight concludes that not doing anything has not changed the future either and laments her inability to predict the future and stop the disaster that way. Spike tells Twilight he knows someone who can help. He then brings Twilight to ""Madame Pinkie's place."" Pinkie has taken up the role of a fortune teller, and begins searching in her crystal ball for Twilight's future. She prophecies that Twilight will receive ""a really cool birthday present next year"". Dissatisfied by this, Twilight begs Pinkie to use her Pinkie Sense to predict what will happen. She says she is unable to do this, stating that her Pinkie sense only predicts immediate, inconsequential events. This is proven by a sudden tail-twitch, resulting in a flowerpot landing on Twilight's head. Pinkie finds it interesting that the pot just came out of nowhere.   In the next scene, Pinkie Pie arrives at the library, and inside she finds Twilight (now with a bandage on her head just like Future Twilight's bandage, due to the flowerpot incident) manning a variety of telescopes, machines and graphs, performing various calculations. Twilight has decided that since doing things, not doing things, and trying to predict the future have not done anything to prevent the disaster, her only choice left is to ""monitor everything."" She uses one of her telescopes to look into the sky, but accidentally aims it at the sun, hurting her eye. Pinkie Pie whips out an eyepatch from the fireplace, stating that she stocks eyepatches all over Ponyville in case of ""an eyepatch emergency"" and puts it on her. With the eyepatch, Twilight looks even more like Future Twilight, and realizes that she has done nothing to stop the catastrophe. Twilight resolves that she only has one option left to stop the disaster: stop time.   Twilight, Pinkie Pie and Spike arrive at Canterlot by train to search for a spell to stop time. After avoiding a guard by pretending to be statues, Spike asks Twilight why they need to wear the black bodysuits, and Twilight tells the other two that the time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing of the archives, which is the most secure. They head off, but Twilight rips her suit on a bush, resulting in her looking just like Future Twilight. They enter the archives and begin to sneak around the guards in order to make their way undetected to the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. They end up going around in a circle and ending up where they started. A guard catches the trio, but recognizes Twilight and opens the door to the wing for her. Once inside the wing, the trio begin searching frantically for the right spell. Unfortunately, they don't find the spell in time, and the sun rises. Twilight ducks under a windowsill, believing that the disaster is about to occur, but nothing happens. Princess Celestia comes across Twilight, but just bids her a happy Tuesday and walks off. Twilight then realizes that there may have not been a disaster after all, and she was just making herself frantic over nothing. She doesn't know what Future Twilight was trying to tell her, but she does realize that she looks ridiculous in her current state.    While she could not find a spell to stop time, Pinkie finds a spell that allows the caster to go back in time once for a short period. Twilight decides to use the spell to warn her past self not to worry about a disaster that isn't going to happen, and exactly the same sequence plays out that happened earlier when Twilight was first met by Future Twilight. After returning, having not being able to warn Past Twilight, she realizes that she was trying to warn herself to not worry, only to be foiled by her past self's fascination of time travel. Thus, she has ensured that the events she was trying to prevent will actually happen. Pinkie reassures her that it's ""Past Twilight's"" problem now. The episode ends as Twilight puts Spike, now experiencing a tummy ache after his ice cream binge, on her back and returning home.     "
"Dragon Quest","Merriwether Williams","2012-03-17","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest"," is the twenty-first   of the second season of   and the forty-seventh episode overall. In this episode,   decides to join the Great Dragon Migration to discover his true identity.   The episode is similar to the G1   episode  . The  ' disrespect towards ponies is a deliberate reflection of the common contempt towards little girls' toys, personified by the ponies. According to  , the main characters learned  's name during the events of this episode.    The episode begins with   and   rapidly digging a hole in the ground. Next,   is shown dragging   to the door of her  , with her and   urging her to go to the ""once in a generation"" dragon migration. Fluttershy is clearly afraid to go, drawing back to her fear of dragons in  . Rainbow Dash says that Fluttershy owes her for the time she spent with her at the butterfly migration, but she resists by hanging on to her front door frame. Eventually losing her temper with a cry of ""NO!!!"", she steamrolls over Rainbow Dash with a hoof to the stomach, and gently opens one of her living room windows to exit through with a jump and runs off, much to Twilight's horror. Rainbow, still lying on the floor, decides to let her off the hook this time.   Twilight, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash are then shown in the finished hole, which turns out to be a viewing trench behind some low-lying bushes, wearing camouflage to try and spot dragons.   finally arrives, wearing a swanky pink, purple and gold camouflage naming herself the ""toast of the trench"", and arriving on a red carpet. They then spot the dragons flying above, and a few of them begin to fight with each other. One of them breathes fire in Rainbow Dash's direction, charring her coat.   is also present, and begins handing out snacks to his friends. But Rainbow Dash makes fun about how he isn't like the other dragons. Rarity rushes to back up Spike from Rainbow Dash's insults, but Spike still ends up storming off, upset.    Spike is up late at night wondering what he is and where he is from. Twilight can’t sleep over Spike talking and tells him she doesn’t know since he was given to her as an egg and she doesn’t know who found him or where. Spike says that doesn’t give him the answers he needs so Twilight suggests some late night research. Spike is surprised and Twilight is confident they will find something. The next morning, neither Twilight nor Spike has found any information on dragons. Twilight says they are apparently too rare and scary for ponies to talk to or study. Spike wonders if dragons cry and Twilight wipes his face, as he starts to cry. Spike pushes her tissue away and says he will discover who he is if it is that last thing he does. Rainbow Dash and Rarity come in and invite Spike and Twilight to breakfast. Twilight agrees but Spike opts out and says he wants to get an early start. Rarity asks him what he means and Spike says he is going on a quest of self-discovery to learn what it means to be a dragon. Spike says that only way to do that is to join the Dragon Migration. Twilight, Rainbow and Rarity are shocked at this. As Spike sets off, they mutter to each other that they will follow him.    Spike sets out on his journey, which takes him across mountains, rivers and forests. Finally, he arrives in the volcanic area that the dragons have migrated to. Spike notices a group of teenage dragons and runs down to them. Unfortunately, he is almost immediately berated by the other dragons, who make fun of his small size and lack of wings. They also accuse him of being ""part pony"", or a ""pony in a dragon costume""; which is ironic, seeing as Rarity, Twilight, and Rainbow Dash are nearby in a dragon costume, having followed Spike to the crater. Spike is challenged to a series of games. The first challenge is a burping contest, which Spike performs poorly in due to only being able to come up with a small burst of magical fire, from which a scroll from   appears. The scroll is tossed into a lava pool by one of the dragons. The next challenge is a tail-wresting competition. Spike first wrestles with the three ponies dressed up as a dragon, and he struggles at this even when the three ponies are not putting up any fight. The costumed ponies collapse on purpose though, to make it look as if Spike won. However, Spike is then put up against a dragon with a giant tail, who catapults him into the side of the crater. The third challenge is dubbed ""king of the hoard"", a play on the game "" "". Spike sneakily climbs up the hill of gems, and softly nudges off the dragon on top. While celebrating, Spike loses his balance and falls down the mound of gems. The final challenge is to find out who could make the largest splash by cannonballing into a pool of lava. Although nervous about the dizzying height, Spike screws up his courage and jumps off the ledge, but lands face down in a painful belly flop and slowly sinks into the lava as the teenagers wince.   Spike assumes he did poorly. However, one of the teenage dragons,  , astounded by Spike's ability to withstand the fall, announces that Spike will be crowned as a dragon, and after being given a noogie in the initiation ceremony, is initiated as a dragon. The dragons then hold a party in which they gorge themselves on gems, after which Spike mentions that he doesn't want to leave the group.   The group of dragons then decide to go on a phoenix egg raid. Spike reluctantly agrees to go, and after saying that he'll just wait behind as he can't fly, is picked up by another dragon and flown to the nest. The dragons observe the two adult phoenixes, and tell Spike to lure them away. Spike pelts the nest with a rock, which prompts the phoenixes to fly after him, leaving their eggs unguarded. When the other dragons move in to steal the eggs, they find that they have hatched into baby phoenixes. The baby phoenixes fly around and disorientate the dragons, and then call for help from their parents. The parents fly back to help their babies, and successfully evade the pursuing dragons using magic.  By the time they return to Spike, they find he has found an unhatched phoenix egg. They egg on Spike to smash the egg on the ground, but he refuses to do so. At this point, Twilight, Rarity and Rainbow Dash show up, and doff their dragon costume. They assert themselves towards the dragons, only to make them laugh. The four then decide to simply run away, and Twilight teleports them away as the dragons gain on them, causing them to crash into a tree. After this, Spike tells the three ponies that they are more than just his friends, they are his family too, and they share a group hug.  Once back in  , Spike begins writing a   to Princess Celestia. In this letter, he says that he has learned that ""who I am is not the same as what I am"". He says that although he was born a dragon, his pony friends have taught him how to be ""kind, loyal and true"", and that he is proud to call them his family. Then, the phoenix egg, which Spike kept, suddenly hatches, and Spike names the baby phoenix  .      "

Stormwalker was cut before storyboards, and Cloudchaser was never designed. The storyboard artists used the Stormwalker design in the scenes where Cloudchaser was in the script and I posed them out in layout.""     begins the episode by flying through   giving out fliers for a mandatory meeting she's holding for all Ponyville  . Later on in the evening, all of the Pegasus ponies gather at  .   waits outside disguised as a tree, but after a quick headcount, Rainbow Dash sees through it and pushes her inside.    Inside the library, Rainbow Dash shows the group of Pegasus ponies an old film cartoon explaining how   requires rainwater to produce the rainclouds for  . In order to obtain this water, Pegasus ponies must work together to make a tornado to funnel water up to Cloudsdale from a reservoir on the ground. The wind speed that a Pegasus can fly is measured in ""wing power,"" and the minimum wind speed required for water to overcome gravity is 800 wing power. The film reel is then damaged in the projector that   is working, so Rainbow Dash takes over. She explains how this year, Cloudsdale has chosen Ponyville's highland reservoir, and that  , captain of  , will be present to oversee the water transfer and take the official record of their top wind speed. She also says that the year before,   made a new wind speed record of 910 wing power, but believes that if they train hard, Ponyville could do better and put out a wind speed power of over 1,000. The other Pegasi react every time she speaks with great enthusiasm, but as they end the meeting with cheers, Rainbow notices that Fluttershy has vanished from where she was standing.   After this, Rainbow Dash appears on a training field in the daytime where a multitude of Pegasus ponies are training for tornado duty, giving out encouragement and pointers where needed. Rainbow notes that every Pegasus resident is present except for Fluttershy. Rainbow goes to  , finding her in a robe with red spots all over her. Fluttershy gives out a few fake coughs and sneezes and tries to claim that she ""really, really wanted to come to training"" but ended up with pony pox. Rainbow does not fall for this ruse and sympathetically says that there's only one cure for pony pox... and then dumps a bucket of cold water onto Fluttershy, rinsing the ""pony pox"" away. Next, Fluttershy falls over and says that she hurt her wing and cannot fly, but Rainbow Dash once again proves otherwise as she startles her with her coach's whistle, prompting her to fly into the air. Rainbow gently persuades her foalhood friend to tell her what's going on and Fluttershy finally cracks, expressing to Rainbow Dash her inability to fly in performances in front of others, which she believes tornado duty to be. She then recollects her experiences at flight camp when the two of them were younger, where her inability to fly properly led the other fillies and colts to laugh at her. Although Rainbow at first snaps at her and says, ""Suck it up, Fluttershy!"", she calms down and tells Fluttershy that she will need every Pegasus' help and every ounce of wing power she can get to break the record, including Fluttershy. Fluttershy refuses until, after Rainbow starts flying away sadly, she finally obliges to help. Back at the training field,   and Spike are present and aid Rainbow Dash by measuring the wing power of each Pegasus, recording the results, and keeping the project organized and on track. Twilight attempts to explain how a machine she has, an anemometer with a wing power gauge, measures the power, but after no one understands her scientific terms, Spike explains in simple English. Twilight then hears someone in the crowd cough; she suspects that it is  , who earlier in the meeting had also been coughing. Twilight sprays him with a disinfectant spray, although the one who coughed was actually  , who is standing behind him, while Rainbow Dash comments that he's trying to pull a ruse to get out of tornado duty. Rainbow starts off by setting Thunderlane around the track to measure his wing power and he gets a rating of 9.3 wing power. Then, Rainbow Dash herself has her wing power measured, and she gets a rating of 16.5 wing power.   Rainbow Dash states that if each and every Pegasus can get their wing power above 10 by the end of the week, they will be able to set the new tornado speed record. After measuring some more Pegasus ponies' wing power, it is Fluttershy's turn. As she slowly makes her way around the track,   and   begin to laugh, reminding her of being bullied at flight camp, which hinders her performance further. In the end, she obtains a wing power rating of 0.5; Twilight and Rainbow try to spin this in a positive light, but this is ruined when Spike ponders the fact that this is actually less than 1 wing power, which earns him a smack upside the head from Twilight. Reminded of her bullying, Fluttershy's confidence is crushed. Rainbow Dash asks her not to leave, but it is to no avail: Fluttershy bursts into tears and runs away, saying she does not have the courage to partake in the tornado.   Fluttershy is then shown crying next to a willow tree, being comforted by   and her various animal friends. The animals attempt to give her the confidence to partake in the event, reminding her of when she instilled confidence in them. They succeed in this when Fluttershy says she will get her confidence up and become a great flyer. With the help of her animal friends, Fluttershy trains by doing wing push-ups with animals on her back, tug-of-war with a pack of butterflies, and flying past dandelions to see if she can dislodge their seeds. As she trains more, she eventually gets better and better, until she can finally do push-ups with several animals on her back, beat a large pack of butterflies in a tug-of-war, and dislodge the seeds from a whole patch of dandelions. She does all this as her animal friends use pony masks to try and imitate the crowd who will be alongside her in the actual event.   Fluttershy arrives back at the track, surrounded by her animal friends, for a second run. She does improve her wing power rating, although it is still comparatively low at 2.3. This once again makes her upset, claiming that her nerves got the best of her. Rainbow tells her that she doesn't care if Fluttershy can't make it to 10 wing power, as every bit will count. Fluttershy asks how Rainbow would feel if it was her that could only fly at 2.5 when everypony else can do 10.0 (Spike points out it was 2.3, earning him another upside-the-head from Twilight). When Rainbow awkwardly waffles on a direct answer, Fluttershy answers that she'd feel humiliated, exactly as she does right now. On the verge of tears, she apologizes and trots away saying she just can't do it. Spike blithely tells Rainbow that she'll still have tons of wing power available to lift the water before an annoyed Twilight drags him away, but Rainbow just wishes that there was a way to lift her friend out of the dumps.   The next day, the Pegasi gather at the highland reservoir where Twilight is in charge of a very large and robust anemometer to record the tornado's wind speed, and Spitfire arrives from Cloudsdale to oversee the transfer. As attendance is taken, it is shown that Thunderlane is not present, and his younger brother   explains that he has the feather flu and is at Ponyville Hospital. Seven other ponies are also absent due to feather flu, and Rainbow Dash is worried they won't break the record - but Twilight calculates that they might not even have enough wing power to get the water up to Cloudsdale  . When Spike asks if they should pack things up, Rainbow decides to ignore the record and just focus on getting the water to Cloudsdale. With the Pegasi ready, Twilight gives the anemometer a final check then has Spike blow on a very large and old carved wooden horn used to signal the start and the end of the tornado, and they begin to form the tornado with the Pegasus ponies who are present. As the Pegasi succeed in beginning to suck the water up the funnel, Fluttershy arrives on the scene to give Rainbow Dash moral support. However, the tornado breaks down as the ponies lose their coordination, tiring and knocking into each other. Rainbow Dash immediately gets up to try again, but Twilight holds her back, concerned that if the formation breaks apart again, somepony could get hurt. Rainbow considers this, but decides to give the tornado one more shot, as she must know if she and her crew gave it their all. Once again, Spike signals the tornado formation, and eventually, the combined power peaks at 795 wing power, just below the required 800 wing power to overcome gravity. With Spitfire only there as an observer, Fluttershy is the only Pegasus left that can help.   After some encouragement from Twilight, Fluttershy puts on a pair of flight goggles and allows herself to be sucked into the tornado. After flailing a bit, she manages to place herself in formation. When Rainbow Dash spots her, she is delighted that Fluttershy is flying with them and together they strain alongside the other Pegasi. She surpasses her previous best wing power rating as her effort causes the meter to climb to 798, but begins to tire and is overtaken by other Pegasus ponies. This begins to remind her once again of the bullying at flight camp, but this time, it strengthens her nerves, allowing her to travel faster than previously. Fluttershy manages to peak out at five wing power, causing the tornado to reach 800.  The water overcomes gravity and to Spitfire's surprise, suddenly explodes out the top of the tornado and is siphoned to Cloudsdale. Spike signals on the horn once more, and the Pegasi safely exit the formation. Once Fluttershy stops flying in circles, she receives much praise. Spitfire congratulates Rainbow Dash on showing ""a lot of guts,"" but Rainbow Dash directs the congratulations to Fluttershy, whom she dubs her ""number one flyer.""    A group of ponies carries her away, chanting her name, as she recites her   to  , in which she mentions her realization that although sometimes you may feel that what you can offer may make only little difference, every contribution counts, and that if "" ""      "

After these feats, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle come to Apple Bloom to tell her how bad of an idea it was.

Miss   goes on to start the meeting, explaining that the previous editor-in-chief graduated, and that the editor-in-chief is the one in charge of the whole paper. She also states that they have a new editor to replace the previous:  . The entire class is surprised, and Diamond Tiara jumps right into the meeting. She explains that nobody takes the school paper seriously, and how she plans to ""deliver [them] to new-found glory,"" with only a single agreement from the rest of the class, and immediately begins handing out orders to the staff photographer, Featherweight. Diamond Tiara states that there will be no more ""Namby-pamby stories like last year's editor,"" referring to  , the previous year's editor-in-chief. She demands that the rest of the crew go out and start reporting. Scootaloo suggests the Crusaders leave the school newspaper, only to be convinced by Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle that it can get them their cutie marks.   Sweetie Belle's first story is an interview with   while she's working on a project. But as she attempts to conduct the interview, her presence inspires Rarity to use her as a test model for the outfit she's working on that features large feathers. Scootaloo's story is about a nest of newly hatched baby birds, where she falls out of a tree and is seen attempting to fly (to the birds' delight), only managing to keep her flank out of the mud. Apple Bloom's story is about the history of  , as told by Granny Smith, but she must first convince the elder   to not focus on albums filled with Apple Bloom's embarrassing baby pictures.   The Cutie Mark Crusaders head back to the   room, bringing their stories with them. Each of their stories is shot down one-by-one by Diamond Tiara, as she corners them and badgers them for better, ""juicier"" stories. The Cutie Mark Crusaders are then thrown out of the back door of the news room, where Sweetie Belle happens to stumble across   and   fighting to get gum out of their coats, only managing to get themselves stuck together. She hurriedly calls Featherweight over to snap pictures of the scene and tells him that she will meet him during lunch. Unable to contain her excitement, Sweetie Belle tells Apple Bloom and Scootaloo about their next big story.   The newest edition of the paper is shown, with the headliner ""Snips and Snails and Bubblegum Fails,"" which could be a reference to the nursery rhyme "" "" and the line "" ."" There is then a profuse amount of laughing and giggling as the foals reading the paper begin making comments, all exclaiming how good the newest edition of the paper is compared to previous. Snips and Snails are proud of ending up in the newspaper, also showing that they got the gum out of their coats. Diamond Tiara is overjoyed at how popular the Cutie Mark Crusaders' column is. She wants more gossip from the Cutie Mark Crusaders, who signed the column with the pseudonym ""Gabby Gums,"" representing all three of them as there was not enough room for their names. Diamond Tiara continues to praise them for their work on the column.   The Cutie Mark Crusaders are then shown sitting at a picnic table drinking what appears to be coffee, trying to think about what to write their next column about. Snips and Snails are seen stuck together with gum once more, attempting to be written about again.   Upon tripping over Sweetie Belle's saddlebag, an annoyed Rarity picks it up to move it. The bag falls open as she picks it up, revealing a copy of the  . Just as Rarity is reading the paper, Sweetie Belle walks in to catch her in the act. She is surprised that Rarity actually likes the school paper, and gives in to Rarity's pleading to show it to her friends. Sweetie Belle rushes out as Rarity is asking questions about Gabby Gums, not answering any of them. She runs to meet with Apple Bloom and Scootaloo at the school playground, stating that they should give up trying to ""squeeze"" stories out of the school, and how they need to expand to writing stories about the residents of Ponyville. Excited, the Cutie Mark Crusaders tell Featherweight to work overtime. Their first Ponyville story is about  ; a snapshot is shown of them holding their crying foals while Diamond Tiara narrates the headline: ""Pound and Pumpkin Cake, Trip to the Store Ends in Tears."" Just then,   runs in exclaiming how the Ponyville Newsstand wants to carry the  , with an ecstatic Diamond Tiara ordering and encouraging the Cutie Mark Crusaders to keep writing the gossip columns. A montage is shown of the process of writing and printing the paper, as well as ponies grabbing the paper as soon as it is off the press.   ,  ,  ,  , Rarity, and   are being treated at the  , when   rushes in with the  . Rarity insists that Rainbow sit down and have a hooficure, but Rainbow resists stubbornly, saying that the day she gets a hooficure is the day she turns in her daredevil license. Twilight explains she enjoys reading Gabby Gums too, but that she finds her a little mean. Reading the headline ""Celestia: Just Like Us,"" Twilight says Gabby Gums doesn't value anyone's privacy. The others brush it off as ""harmless gossip"" and laugh at a few of the other headlines. Twilight also explains how she feels sorry for the ponies featured in Gabby's columns, and Rainbow shoots it down as it being ""awesome"" to get your name in the paper. Rarity again insists that Rainbow should join them in getting a hooficure, which she reluctantly accepts, just as Featherweight steps into the doorway with a camera. Upon the spa pony's attempt to file Rainbow's hoof, Rainbow flies away in fear, stating that she hates ponies touching her hooves. Then she says that she ""would love it if Gabby Gums did a story on [her]."" Spike responds that Gabby Gums already did a story on himself.   Trying to go a different route, the Cutie Mark Crusaders attempt to write about an interview with Spike. They are shot down by Diamond Tiara, and decide to go back to their ""usual gossip."" Sweetie Belle realizes that they might be hurting other ponies with their gossip, and Apple Bloom and Scootaloo agree, saying they didn't want to say anything because everybody loved it so much. Sweetie Belle opts for giving the public what they want, that being gossip, and the others reluctantly agree.   The next edition of the   features a gossip column about Applejack being asleep on the job, and Big McIntosh hiding something, with a picture of   sitting down with  . There is also a column about Twilight titled ""Twilight Sparkle: I Was a Canterlot Snob,"" detailing how Spike told Gabby Gums Twilight's supposed opinion of Ponyville. Spike claims Gabby Gums made it up, and Rarity reiterates her opinion about how Gabby Gums is just a harmless newspaper columnist. The next story is about Fluttershy, who slowly sinks under the table at the announcement of the headline ""Fluttershy Has Tail Extensions."" Pinkie Pie, being outraged at first, reluctantly admits that the headline ""Pinkie Pie is an Out of Control Party Animal"" is true. The Cake family rushes in as Twilight reads the headline ""The Cakes are Breaking Up!"" Rainbow breaks through the door with a large pile of newspapers, upset about being called a ""Super Softie"" in the headlines, and wails over being a laughing stock. Rarity, still saying that the gossip is harmless and all of the other ponies are over-reacting, finally finds the headline ""The Drama Queen Diaries."" Gabby Gums reprinted her diary, Rarity says that she will destroy her. Twilight suggests that they should talk to Sweetie Belle to get to the bottom of Gabby Gum's identity. Rarity defends her sister, saying that she would never associate herself with someone as ""beastly"" as Gabby Gums. Upon arriving home, she opens Sweetie Belle's saddlebag to find her diary, astonished by her sister's treacherous act. From this, Rarity concludes that Sweetie Belle is indeed Gabby Gums.    Rarity kicks open her bedroom door and finds Sweetie Belle reading through her notepad on the floor. Sweetie Belle is surprised at Rarity finding out, and asks how, to be informed that her reprinting of her big sister's diary was her giveaway. Rarity then reiterates Twilight's point earlier on, about how gossip can be a very hurtful thing, and how it can be an invasion of privacy, just like when Rarity searched through Sweetie Belle's saddlebag. Sweetie Belle explains that they are only doing this because of how badly they want their cutie marks, and Rarity explains that making people feel horrible is not something to want as a destiny.  The Cutie Mark Crusaders continue to confront Diamond Tiara about quitting, and are again shot down. Diamond Tiara says she doesn't care about other ponies' feelings. The Cutie Mark Crusaders try to quit again, only to be confronted with embarrassing photos taken by Featherweight, from when they were working on their first stories, that Diamond Tiara threatens to print instead if they don't come up with a story.    The Cutie Mark Crusaders attempt to find a way out of the situation but ask around for stories for the moment. They first try asking Rainbow, only for her to push a raincloud over their heads. Next, they try Fluttershy, and when arriving at her house, notice a puddle leaking under the door.   opens the door, and Fluttershy is seen crying in the background. Angel then slams the door in their faces. They then head to Twilight's library, only to discover that a force field has been placed around it. Spike yells at the trio that Twilight had anticipated such a visit and had put the barrier up. Lastly, they try Applejack and Big Mac, who are still mad at them due to their feature in the paper. In a reversal of character, Applejack is laconic while Big Mac explains why the Crusaders should be ashamed of themselves and tells them to leave them be. As the Cutie Mark Crusaders walk through town, everyone turns their head away from them and closes their windows and shutters. They regroup at their club house, where they discuss the situation, and how Diamond Tiara will publish their blackmail pictures the next day if they do not meet their deadline. They decide that they will not leave the clubhouse until they figure out a solution.   Just as the sun rises, and Diamond Tiara instructs to have the unopened file of blackmail pictures printed, the Cutie Mark Crusaders run in with a Gabby Gums column. Diamond Tiara, in a hurry to get the next edition out on time, does not read the column before sending it to the press. As she exits the schoolhouse, she catches   reading the newest edition of the paper, and pulls it out of her hooves to read it. Astonished at the title, Diamond Tiara sets out for revenge, and vows to print their blackmail photos the next day. The column that the Cutie Mark Crusaders submitted instead is an open letter of their apology to all of the residents of Ponyville for the pain and embarrassment that they caused, and also reveals who Gabby Gums is, being Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Apple Bloom. The column explains their reasoning for writing the previous gossip columns, being that the popularity of the column made them ignore the feeling of wrongness it caused, and asks for Ponyville's forgiveness. They conclude it by signing off for the last time as Gabby Gums.   Everyone in Ponyville forgives the Cutie Mark Crusaders after reading their letter, and Cheerilee admits her mistake in that she might've given too much power to a first-time editor.

"MMMystery on the Friendship Express","Amy Keating Rogers","2012-04-07","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/MMMystery_on_the_Friendship_Express"," is the twenty-fourth   of the second season of   and the fiftieth episode overall. After a cake   had been guarding for a contest is partially eaten on the way to  , she starts out an investigation to find out the culprit. The title is a reference to the 1934 crime novel  , written by  .   On  , the episode's writer   revealed that she wrote a scene in which   commends   for her self-control, and Applejack confesses to taking a bite while   was asleep and leaving no clues. However, it was cut for time.    The episode begins with   commenting on a large cake that   have made for the National Dessert Competition in  . Pinkie is in charge of its transport and excited about the responsibility.   interrupts Pinkie, pointing out that   is getting exhausted from holding the cake on his back.  Pinkie puts on a hardhat with a red, flashing light, and guides Big McIntosh out the door, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Outside, the street has been blocked off so that the cake can be moved safely. As Big McIntosh falters under the weight of the cake, Mr. Cake faints out of terror. Big McIntosh manages to keep the cake upright. Pinkie calls on   and   to help him by holding the cake's tray up with ropes. After the cake nearly falls a second time, and Mr. Cake faints once again, Pinkie recruits  's help. Twilight casts a protective magic bubble around the cake. Pinkie Pie asks Applejack and   to help by holding a trampoline behind the cake.    The side panel of the  's dessert car is removed for the cake to be loaded on, and Big McIntosh hammers it back in place. Pinkie Pie thanks her friends for helping to get the cake to and aboard the train, and Twilight Sparkle thanks her for letting them accompany her to the National Dessert Competition. Rarity talks about how much fun the festivities will be, while Applejack ponders how good all the treats will taste and reaches her hoof out to the Marzipan cake, only to have her hoof smacked aside by Pinkie Pie. Pinkie then gushes about the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness—or as she nicknames it, the ""MMMM""—describing its deliciousness and believing that it will win first prize. Just then, three other National Dessert Competition participants board the train.  , a pompous   with a French accent, declares that his Exquisite Éclairs will win first prize.  , the unicorn stallion with a Brooklyn accent that operates Twilight and  's favorite donut shop in Canterlot, carts in his ""Donutopia"", a small city model made out of sprinkled donuts. Lastly arrives  , a mule with a large chocolate mousse moose, and brags how winning will make her the greatest chef in  . The four entrants argue amongst themselves as the train starts moving. Twilight then recommends that everyone gets rest, and Gustave, Joe, and Mulia head to their compartments. The ponies head to their own compartments only to be stopped by Pinkie, who states that the group needs to guard ""MMMM"" from the other chefs and potential saboteurs. Believing that Pinkie Pie is overreacting, Twilight and the others retire to their compartments. Pinkie Pie, however, decides to spend the night guarding the ""MMMM"".    Pinkie Pie stays awake to keep a close eye on the cake and almost falls asleep while doing so. A shadowy figure zooms behind her, and Pinkie Pie chases the figure through the train cars to the end of the train. When Pinkie reaches the caboose, she cannot find the culprit. Pinkie heads back to the dessert car and notices the shadowy figure again. She once again chases it until she reaches the engine, where she finds the shadow of the engineer shoveling coal into the firebox. Pinkie Pie returns to the dessert car to resume guarding the cake, but the shades are suddenly closed. In the dark a 'thief' hits a painting by the door while leaving the room, leaving it askew. After straightening the picture, Pinkie Pie tries to continue her vigil but falls asleep.   Pinkie Pie wakes up and sees that the cake appears fine. Twilight Sparkle comes in the room and notices large bite marks on the three bottom tiers of the back side of the cake. Pinkie Pie screams that the cake has been half-eaten, waking up the other bakers and the rest of her friends. Pinkie dons a   hat and bubble   and gives Twilight a  . Pinkie declares that she knows who ""dun' did it"" and accuses Gustave of ruining the ""MMMM"". The scene cuts to a fantasy reminiscent of an old, black and white silent film. In the fantasy, Gustave is a mustachioed villain who grabs Pinkie and ties her to train tracks with an oncoming train coming towards her. The scene flashes to a conveyor belt where ""MMMM"" is placed in-front of a buzz saw which cuts the cake clean in half. Snapping back to reality, Twilight points out the flaws in Pinkie's story, mainly that Pinkie is present and not tied to train tracks and that the cake was eaten instead of cut. Pinkie then proclaims that Donut Joe is the culprit. The scene cuts to another fantasy: a James Bond parody with Donut Joe as a spy called Con Mane. Con Mane gases Pinkie, knocking her unconscious, and uses another gas to uncover lasers guarding ""MMMM"". He uses a mirror to make the lasers cut the cake into pieces. Ending the fantasy, Twilight points out the flaws in her second story, namely that there is no laser beam security system and Donut Joe does not fit into the role of the ""sleek, stealthy Con Mane"" instead being ""big, gruff and messy"". Pinkie then blames everything on Mulia Mild. In a third fantasy, Mulia Mild is a ninja on top of the train. Mild sneaks behind Pinkie and knocks her out with a frying pan. Mild pulls out a sword and slices the cake into pieces. Twilight, again, ends the fantasy by reiterating that the cake was not cut, and that Mild is too old and fidgety to be a stealthy ninja. Defeated, Pinkie gushes about how good the other chefs' desserts look. The train goes into a pitch dark tunnel and ponies start to scream. The other chefs' desserts are now also destroyed. Twilight sends everyone but Pinkie, as she was the only witness, to their cars as they perform an investigation.    Twilight swaps hats with Pinkie Pie and the two then retrace Pinkie's steps when she was watching the cake. When they reach the caboose, Twilight finds a clue (though it is hidden from view). Retracing further, the two go to the engine where Twilight inspects the engineer's hat and finds a second clue. Back in the dessert car, Twilight discovers a third clue on the bumped painting. Everyone then meets in the dessert car and Twilight reveals the first clue: a blue feather belonging to Rainbow Dash. Twilight explains that Rainbow Dash was the first shadowy figure who zipped past her. When Pinkie reached the caboose, Rainbow Dash hovered close to the ceiling to avoid being seen. Twilight then reveals the second clue: a strand of pink hair that belongs to Fluttershy. The second shadowy figure was Fluttershy, who donned the driver's hat (piling her long mane into it) and neckerchief and began shoveling coal to fool Pinkie. The third clue is half a set of false eyelashes that belong to Rarity. Rarity used her magic to shut the shades and darken the room. When she left, she slammed her head into the painting, leaving one set of fake eyelashes on it; upon realizing it this morning, she adjusted her mane to hang over her right eye. Rarity then admits that she wears fake eyelashes and that she took a bite of the cake. Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash also admit they ate some of the cake.  All three only meant to take one bite, but it was so delicious that they ended up having a lot more than they were planning to. They explain that Pinkie Pie's earlier description on the cake enticed them into trying it. The three culprits apologize to Pinkie, who forgives them. With the mystery of the cake solved, Twilight gives the deerstalker to Pinkie, who uses what she's learned to look for the clues to solve the mystery of who devoured the other bakers' desserts. Pinkie soon reveals that the bakers all have traces of another baker's confections on them, and deduces that they ate each other's desserts: Joe has éclair in his hair, Gustave has mousse in his mustache, and Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles. The bakers confess to the crimes, stating (once again) that Pinkie's earlier description of the desserts enticed each one into eating them. Equally guilty, the bakers all forgive each other. The train reaches Canterlot with all the desserts destroyed. However, Pinkie has an idea of how they can all enter with their goods.   Pinkie and the group head up to the competition with their newly made dessert—a combination of all the bakers' confections—and conclude that you mustn't accuse others of a wrongdoing without any proof, as it can hurt their feelings and make them look silly. They celebrate their success and teamwork with   and a piece of cake, which Pinkie turns down only to devour the rest of the entire cake, leaving her incredibly bloated before she eats the fourth wall.   Four dishes are made to travel to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition. The four dishes are the plot device for this episode.   The  , called by Pinkie as the "" "", is the dish created by  . It is a 4 tiered pink pound cake with cream of meringue sandwiched between the layers, covered with a lemon yellow mascarpone with whipped cream on the top, and the marzipan of red flowers, apples, oranges, and grapes on the side.    is the dish created by the griffon  .

Applejack will provide catering for the reception, Pinkie Pie will host it, Fluttershy will train and conduct the bird choir, Rainbow Dash will perform a   during the ceremony, and Rarity will design the wedding dresses. Twilight receives the keystone job of overseeing the preparations. Twilight is shocked to learn that the bride and groom are ""Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"" and Twilight's brother,  . Twilight is upset because he never told her about his wedding or Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. In a song called   (""Big Brother Best Friend Forever""), Twilight recalls how she and Shining Armor used to do everything together, and how much she misses him.   On the   ride to Canterlot, everyone except Twilight happily discusses the wedding, and only Applejack notices Twilight's glumness. Upon inquiry, Twilight says that she is still thinking about Shining Armor's neglect of her, though Applejack tells her not to worry.   At Canterlot, it is evident that there has been an increase in security: the train passes through a pink protective sphere encasing the city, there are many guards at the station, and Princess Celestia keeps watch with the aid of a telescope from the balcony of the highest tower. Shining Armor is happy to see his sister and affectionately calls her ""Twily.” Twilight immediately berates him for not telling her about the wedding, but Shining Armor explains that he had no choice and Princess Celestia wanted an increase in security in response to an exterior threat. Twilight concedes but remains hurt. Shining Armor reassures her that she has always been, and always will be, important to him, and asks her to be his Best Mare. Shining Armor explains that Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is the full name of  , Twilight's former foalsitter. Twilight proclaims her to be ""beautiful, caring, and kind"" and ""the best foalsitter ever.” A flashback shows that filly Twilight and Cadance used to frolic in the park, play on the swings, and resolve lovers' quarrels. Twilight remembers their chant:    Twilight sees Cadance and eagerly reminds her of their chant. However, Cadance fails to recognize it and proves indifferent to Twilight. Shining Armor announces that Cadance will be monitoring the wedding planning. When he says that they are happy to have Twilight there, Cadance smiles at Twilight malevolently.    Twilight begins overseeing the wedding preparations, starting in a castle kitchen Applejack has been provided. When Cadance shows up to check the catering, Applejack offers her an apple fritter, which Cadance insincerely calls ""delicious.” Applejack gives Cadance a bag of fritters in case she forgets to stop for a meal, but when Applejack turns around, Cadance tosses the fritters into the trash. Twilight, incensed by Cadance's ingratitude, visits Rarity, who is working in the tower room she stayed at in  . Twilight begins to describe Cadance's temperamental behavior, but Cadance arrives with her bridesmaids, ( ,  , and  ). Cadance ignores Rarity’s greeting and appraises her dress. She says that she was hoping for more beading and a longer train, and turns her attention to the bridesmaids' dresses. Displeased, she demands that Rarity make them in a different color, despite the fact that her bridesmaids love their dresses. Rarity is more than happy to comply with the royal demands, but Twilight calls Cadance ""Princess Demandypants"" when Cadance is out of earshot. After nightfall, Cadance meets Pinkie Pie inside the castle ballroom. Pinkie presents her flamboyant reception plans, which include a board game, carnival music, and dancing. Cadance compares the setup to a ""party for a six-year old,” although Pinkie Pie is oblivious to the insult. Meanwhile, Twilight has been eavesdropping on their exchange.    enters the shield and switches places with Princess Celestia on the tower balcony for the night. Meanwhile, the six friends and Spike are sipping drinks after a day of work. Twilight seizes the opportunity to find fault with Cadance, calling her the ""absolute worst bride-to-be ever.” However, her friends rationalize Cadance's behavior. Fluttershy mentions that Cadance criticized one of the choir birds during rehearsal, but the bird in question was off-key. The friends suggest that Twilight is still being excessively protective of her brother, but Twilight insists that her friends are too preoccupied with wedding preparations to notice Cadance's attitude. Frustrated, she storms off.  Twilight visits her brother's house and tries to talk to him privately, but is interrupted by Cadance, who is also intent on speaking with him. Twilight watches Cadance scold Shining Armor about a crest he is planning to wear with his dress uniform, which belonged to his favorite uncle. Shining Armor protests and Cadance swiftly casts a spell on him, making him to go wall-eyed. Frightened, Twilight runs away. Shining Armor sees Twilight running off and wonders what she wanted to tell him.   Twilight runs to the castle to where her friends are staying. Her friends explain that Cadance has chosen them to be her new bridesmaids, and they interpret it as a reward for their diligence and evidence of Cadance’s good intentions. Nobody knows where the former bridesmaids are or listens to Twilight's warning. Twilight leaves, saying, ""Looks like I really am on my own.""  The wedding rehearsal takes place the next day, but Twilight is not there. When Shining Armor turns to take his wedding ring, Twilight bursts into the wedding hall, proclaiming that neither she nor Shining Armor should stand next to Cadance. Ignoring the inquiries of Fluttershy and Applejack, she approaches the podium and points at Cadance, crying, ""She's EVIL!"" While aggressively cornering Cadance, Twilight condemns Cadance's behavior towards her friends, the sudden disappearance of the bridesmaids, and the spell she cast on Shining Armor. Cadance, bewildered by Twilight's accusations, runs away in tears. Twilight chases her out and proudly trots back into the hall. However, Shining Armor contradicts each of Twilight’s accusations. He claims that Cadance's   was intended to alleviate his migraines, which were caused by 24/7 maintenance of the protective magic barrier; Cadance replaced her bridesmaids because of their apparently shallow motivations; and her brusque behavior towards Twilight's friends appeared to be due to the stress of having to make all of the decisions for the wedding in her groom’s absence defending Canterlot. Shining Armor contrasts Cadance's efforts with Twilight's apparent lack of concern for the wedding. He dismisses Twilight from her position as Best Mare and suggests that she not attend the wedding at all. Her friends and Princess Celestia also leave to check on Cadance. Twilight is left in the wedding hall alone, where she   the loss of a brother and a potential sister. She begins to doubt her opinion of Cadance.   When Twilight is still in the hall, Cadance appears and comforts her, stroking her mane affectionately. When Twilight apologizes, Cadance's eyes turn green, and she says that Twilight   be sorry. Cadance summons a ring of green fire, which engulfs Twilight in a sphere of energy. Cadance walks out of the room as the sphere and Twilight sink into the ground.      "

Twilight teleports herself and Cadance to the cave's exit, but they are confronted by the bridesmaids:  ,  , and  .   is about to pronounce the couple mare and colt when Twilight and Cadance burst in. A flashback reveals that Cadance and Twilight distracted the bewitched bridesmaids with a bouquet of flowers before escaping from the cave. She declares the imposter to be a  , a creature that takes the form of a loved one and gains power by feeding off of love. The imposter, enraged, reveals her true form:  , Queen of the Changelings. Chrysalis says that   has more love than any place she's ever encountered, and conquering Equestria will give her and her changeling army more power than they've ever dreamed of. Even as she speaks, the changeling army is battering away at Canterlot's defenses. Princess Celestia, infuriated at having been deceived, declares that even though Shining Armor is powerless, she will defend her subjects. She fires a white-golden beam of magic at Chrysalis, who retaliates with a green beam of magic. Chrysalis' beam overpowers Celestia's, smacking Celestia to the floor, knocking off her tiara, causing her mane and tail to stop flowing, and scorching her horn. Chrysalis is astonished by the power she has gained from Shining Armor's love. Struggling to remain conscious, Celestia instructs the six main characters to retrieve the  , their only hope for stopping Chrysalis.    The six ponies race towards Canterlot Tower where the elements are held. The changelings finally shatter the protective sphere and start wreaking havoc in the city. The six ponies are hemmed in by a crowd of hungry, vicious changelings, which take on the appearance of the six. Using everything from their hooves to Pinkie Pie's  , the six ponies defeat the first wave of changelings. However, their reprieve is short; Canterlot Tower has already been overrun by more changelings. With the numbers stacked heavily against the Mane Six, they are eventually captured.  The changelings have imprisoned Celestia in a lime green goo cocoon in the wedding hall and glued Cadance’s hooves to the floor with the same substance. Cadance insists that the six friends will save them, but a group of Changelings walk in with the friends held in custody. Chrysalis gloats that everyone but Twilight was too fixated on the wedding to notice anything. Applejack apologizes on behalf of the others for ignoring Twilight’s doubts, and Twilight assures Applejack that she has no hard feelings. Chrysalis sings   to the tune of This Day Aria as she observes the chaos in the streets below.   Twilight frees Cadance and urges her to try and break the spell on Shining Armor. Cadance embraces him and breaks his trance with her spell of love. Shining Armor says that he doesn’t have the strength to repel the changelings, but Cadance declares that her love will give him strength. The two connect horns, creating a powerful, bright pink, purple and white whirlwind of magic that lifts the couple into the air and shakes the room. When they look into each other's eyes, their bodies glow with bright white light and take on a heart shape as the magic expands outward as a bright, purple sphere. The ponies shade their eyes from the light, while Chrysalis and the changelings are thrown  . With the changelings gone, and Celestia free from her cocoon, the ponies prepare for the real royal wedding.  At the wedding, Twilight takes her reinstated place as best mare as their parents look on proudly from the audience. Celestia pronounces Cadance and Shining Armor mare and colt and levitates their rings onto their horns. Celestia commends the heroism of Twilight and her friends and emphasizes the importance of trusting one's instincts. The bride and groom step out to a balcony to wave to a crowd of cheering ponies. As Shining Armor and Cadance kiss, Celestia reminds Rainbow Dash to perform her   for the ceremony.   The scene changes to the evening wedding reception in the courtyard, where the newlyweds start dancing.   joins her sister and the Mane Six and unknowingly asks if she missed anything.   works her turntables and Twilight sings   while a montage of humorous and memorable photos taken during the party is shown. At the end of the party, Shining Armor thanks Twilight and they hug. Before departing, Cadance tosses her bouquet to the onlookers, which Rarity, in a screaming fit, snatches from the other bridesmaids. Twilight and her friends happily watch the royal carriage depart, and Spike unknowingly humors them by saying that he has even better plans for the bachelor party. The episode ends as fireworks light the sky above Canterlot.     "
"The Crystal Empire - Part 1","Meghan McCarthy","2012-11-10","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crystal_Empire_-_Part_1"," is the first   of the third season of   and the fifty-third episode overall.  It is the first half of a two-part episode. In this episode, a curse that caused   to vanish for a thousand years has finally ended.   orders   and her friends to help defend the newly awakened Empire against  , the evil unicorn who had cursed the empire.     In the royal   castle, an Earth pony   dashes into the throne room to inform   that ""  has returned"". Celestia, now deeply worried, orders the guards to find   and   and writes a letter to   telling her to come to Canterlot at once.  In  , Twilight Sparkle rushes to pack quills, flash cards, and reference books.   tries to calm her down and says that it's just a test, but Twilight indignantly asks, ""Just a test?"" Spike puts on a helmet and shields himself with pillows before reluctantly answering ""Yes"".   says, ""I think she handled that pretty well, considering-"" but Twilight screams and launches the entire library into the air to vent her frustration. Meanwhile, in   Castle, Princess Celestia and   look at a new stained glass window depicting Princess Cadance and Shining Armor  . Celestia tells Luna that she should not go to the   because Twilight and her friends will join Princess Cadance and Shining Armor there. Luna fears for the collapse of the Crystal Empire again. Celestia reassures her that Twilight will succeed at her task, bringing her one step closer to ""being ready"". Twilight walks in with a saddlebag of quills, paper, and books, ready to take a written test. With a soft assurance from Celestia to trust her, Luna leaves the room to let the two speak alone. Celestia solemnly tells Twilight that she will not be taking the kind of test she is expecting.   Princess Celestia tells Twilight that the Crystal Empire has returned. Twilight doesn't remember reading about the Crystal Empire, and Celestia says that very few actually remember its existence. She uses a pink crystal to create a three-dimensional model of the Crystal Empire, admitting that her knowledge about the empire is limited to the fact that it contains a powerful magic. Celestia describes how  , an evil unicorn with a heart ""as black as night"", conquered the Crystal Empire and ruled tyrannically over its citizens. Celestia and Luna defeated King Sombra and banished him to the ""ice of the arctic north"", but not before King Sombra cursed the Crystal Empire and caused it to vanish. Celestia tells Twilight, ""If the kingdom is filled with hope and love, then those things would spread all across  ."" Celestia fires a beam of her golden yellow   at the crystal, illuminating the room in a rainbow of colors. She grimly continues, ""But if hatred and fear take hold..."" At which point, her horn glows purple and her eyes turn green (like those of King Sombra's) as she fires a pitch-black beam at it. The crystal casts a black shadow, and tall black crystals spring up around Twilight. Celestia shatters the black crystals and explains that she needs Twilight to protect the Crystal Empire. As Celestia escorts her student out of the throne room, Twilight sees that Luna has been waiting by the double doors, but she only returns Twilight's look with a serious expression. Twilight fears that she will fail, but Celestia is confident in Twilight's abilities and guarantees her that she will move on to the next level of her studies after she saves the empire. Celestia gives her one last piece of information: in the end, it must be Twilight, and her alone, who ultimately helps her sister-in-law and brother protect the Crystal Empire. Receiving Twilight's affirmation, Celestia sends her on her way. Twilight steps out of the castle and sings   to express how she doesn't feel prepared for the mission. She and her friends take a   to the outskirts of the Crystal Empire and disembark in the middle of a snowy, windy, wasteland. Shining Armor, wearing a scarf and goggles, meets them and tells them to hurry because it is dangerous beyond the empire's borders. King Sombra suddenly appears in the form of great clouds of black smoke and starts pursuing the ponies. The friends break into a run and Shining Armor stops to confront Sombra. Sombra's black smoke dodges the beams of magic that the prince shoots at it and plunges straight at him as he braces for the attack.   The friends reach the safety of the Crystal Empire, passing through a bright blue bubble surrounding the empire. Shining Armor joins them, but his horn has become encrusted with small black crystals. He tries to cast a spell, but the crystals impede his magic and he sadly shakes his head at Twilight. The ponies gaze at the resplendent city and   exclaims, ""Sparkleriffic!"" As the ponies walk through the deserted streets towards the castle,   is dazzled by the crystalline roads and buildings, but   is not wowed.   reminds Rarity that they are here to help Twilight, not admire the scenery.   In a room overlooking the Empire, the friends find Princess Cadance slumped on the throne. Her horn is constantly emitting blue magic and she has bags under her eyes. Cadance is excited to see Twilight, and they sing their ""Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake!"" childhood rhyme. Suddenly, thunder strikes outside, and Cadance's magic flickers. Shining Armor sadly explains that Cadance is exhausted from constantly maintaining the magical barrier to keep Sombra out. Cadance is so tired, she hasn't been able to get any sleep and barely eats any food. Cadance insists she's fine, but her husband tells Twilight that she can't keep the shield up forever. He says that they have been too busy to gather information about the   (Rarity is ecstatic at the mention of ""Crystal Ponies""). Twilight is more than happy to embark on what she calls a ""research paper"".   Twilight and Spike attempt to interview the glum Crystal Pony  . Sapphire Joy says she can't remember anything from the time before King Sombra came to power, nor does she want to remember. Apologizing for being unable to provide further assistance, she retreats to her house and closes the door. Rainbow Dash asks   for information on how to protect the empire, but the pony responds in the same listless manner, saying that even though she wants to help, she has no information.   is too shy to talk to the ponies passing by. Pinkie Pie, who is wearing a black suit and ""night vision goggles"", descends on a rope to eavesdrop on   and   Crystal Pony, but scares them away. Rarity is engrossed in imagining how beautiful her mane would be if she were a Crystal Pony too, and the ponies around her uncomfortably back away. The friends reconvene at the base of the castle. Pinkie Pie, dressed up as Fluttershy, tiptoes up to Twilight and looks around before taking off her costume. Pinkie hisses, ""My cover has been blown. I repeat, my cover has been blown!"" Applejack says that the Crystal Ponies seem to have some kind of ""collective amnesia"", but one pony said something about the local library. The friends head to the library, an impressive three floor facility. Twilight asks the librarian   where the history books are located. Amethyst Maresbury can't remember where the history texts are located, and says she isn't even sure if she works there. The friends look for the book and Twilight finally finds the book they need:  . Twilight brings the book to Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. She reads aloud a section about the  , an annual festival that was established by the  . The annual Faire was held to restore the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm. With Shining Armor's encouragement, Twilight takes on the task of setting up a Faire for the Crystal Ponies with her friends.    The Mane Six sing   while setting up the Faire. In keeping with tradition, Twilight crafts a crystal heart to showcase at the center of the Faire. With the preparations complete, Twilight announces the beginning of the Faire from the castle balcony. The Crystal Ponies eagerly walk to the base of the castle where the Faire is located, and one by one, regain their beautiful crystal colors as they partake of the food and games. The same glum pony that Twilight had interviewed earlier tells her friend that she's starting to remember how life was like before the king. They look at each other, cry ""The Crystal Heart!"" and delightedly smile as they regain their former colors. When they wonder if   Crystal Heart is really present at the Faire, Rainbow Dash assures them that they do: ""Can't have a Crystal Faire without a crystal heart, right?"" Amethyst Maresbury comments that the light within the Crystal Ponies powers the Crystal Heart and protects the empire. She regains her own colors as she remembers that she   work in the library. Rainbow Dash anxiously asks Amethyst Maresbury what she means by ""powering"" the Crystal Heart. Amethyst Maresbury, not knowing that the real Heart is missing, merely says she's glad they found it, considering Sombra said he hid it where nopony could find it. As she walks off for some funnel cake, Applejack and Rainbow Dash become extremely worried when they realize the significance of the actual Crystal Heart. Rainbow Dash tears a flag from a pole and covers the useless heart-shaped crystal with it, lest the Crystal Ponies find out that it is a fake. She tells Twilight that they have a problem.   Rainbow Dash and Twilight meet the royal couple on the balcony. Twilight exclaims that the book said nothing about the Crystal Heart, and discovers that the last page was ripped out. Princess Cadance tells her it's okay, but suddenly faints into Shining Armor's arms and gasps for air as the magical shield fades. Black smoke rushes across the perimeter of the Empire, weaving its way to the castle. King Sombra's face appears as he viciously growls.     "

It is the second episode of a two-parter which begins the season. In this episode,   and   search for the   while their friends try to protect the   from  .     The episode starts with a short recap of   and continues after   faints, causing the magical shield to vanish.   prepares to charge into the city, but   helps Cadance recover in time to restore the shield. The shield slices off a small piece of his horn, which falls to the ground as a dark crystal.   instructs her friends to entertain the   at the   while she searches for the real Crystal Heart. At first, she doesn’t want   to come along on this dangerous mission, but she relents when he promises not to lift a single claw to help her. Meanwhile, the friends come up with ways to distract the  .   addresses   as ""Knight Fluttershy"", announcing that it's showtime.   prevents the carnival-goers from unveiling the fake Crystal Heart.  Twilight deduces that King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart in the castle, since nopony would be brave enough to set foot in there during his rule. In the throne room, she finds a large crystal at the crest of the throne's backrest. Remembering how   replicated King Sombra's   in the  , Twilight does the same and the crystal's black light reveals a spiral staircase in the center of the room. Twilight begins her descent down the long, dark staircase, telling Spike to keep an eye on the situation outside. When Spike warns her that Cadance's magic is fading faster than ever, Twilight trips and tumbles down the staircase.   At the bottom of the stairwell, Twilight replicates King Sombra's magic again to open a door. When Twilight crosses the threshold, she sees Princess Celestia in the   throne room. Celestia sternly tells Twilight that she has failed her test and is no longer her student. Twilight begins to cry as Sombra laughs. The camera zooms out to show Twilight sitting in front of a wall. Spike catches up with her and asks her if she is all right. The whites of Twilight's eyes, which have turned green, become normal as she snaps out of her vision. She steps out of the way and lets Spike approach the door. His eyes turn green and he cries, ""Please, Twilight, don't leave me!"" Twilight slams the door shut, telling him that King Sombra has bewitched the door to make it show their worst fears. She reassures Spike that she will never send him away and uses her magic to open the real door. They see a light blue staircase snaking up the exterior of a tower. Like the dark staircase, this one seems to have no end. The scene changes to show Princess Cadance, whose magic is faltering as she struggles to keep it going. King Sombra’s magic rapidly penetrates the kingdom, leaving two black trails. At the Faire, Crystal Ponies cheer as Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, dressed in armor, prepare to joust with blunted lances attached to their chests.  , seeing an ominous thunderclap, blows on her flugelhorn, signaling the two ponies to charge. Fluttershy panics when they collide and is launched in the air. Dash exhorts her to continue, saying that the fate of an empire rests on showing the Crystal Ponies a good time. Neither of them notice several buildings become tainted with Sombra's magic. The camera cuts to Twilight and Spike wearily trekking up the staircase. Twilight looks up and is inspired to perform an anti-gravity spell, allowing her and Spike to slide down the underside of the staircase. Whooping with glee, Twilight explains that she had studied gravity spells for her test.    The camera cuts back to the Faire. As the sky darkens, Rarity frantically crafts traditional baskets and hands them to the Crystal Ponies, but runs out of materials. The ponies become aware that King Sombra has returned, and anxiously surround what they think is the Crystal Heart. Rarity and Applejack look up at the castle balcony, where Princess Cadance has collapsed in Shining Armor's forelegs. Pinkie Pie is juggling flugelhorns on a bouncy ball but slips. The ball knocks over the flag covering the fake Crystal Heart, which clatters to the ground before the shocked ponies. Rarity is about to say something, but is interrupted by Applejack, stating that the real Crystal Heart is on its way. Rarity whispers to Applejack that she was going to say that the Crystal Heart was being polished to buy time. As Applejack sheepishly realizes her mistake, Sombra's laughter echoes overhead. The citizens scatter, crying, ""It's him!"" Twilight and Spike reach the top of the tower to see the resplendent, light blue Crystal Heart suspended above a wide circular disc. When Twilight steps onto the disc, it begins flashing like an alarm and alerts King Sombra. He throws up a wall of black crystals around the perimeter of the disc, trapping Twilight. She knocks the Heart out of the prison just in time and it lands a short distance from Spike.    An outside shot of the tower reveals it to be the center tower of the castle, the highest point of the building. Twilight tries to escape from the trap, but it teleports her back in. Realizing she cannot deliver the Heart herself, she tells Spike that he must do it. Spike grabs it and jumps off the tower just as black crystals pierce the floor. The camera pans to Applejack and Rarity nervously reassuring the Crystal Ponies from the castle balcony. The last few wisps of magic vanish from Cadance's horn and the barrier disintegrates. A Crystal Pony tries to make a run for it, but she bumps into a towering crystal, where King Sombra appears and says, ""My crystal slaves...""   Spike dodges the black crystals while making his way down the exterior of the tower. He calls down to the others that he has the Crystal Heart, and King Sombra growls, ""That is mine!"" He charges towards Spike as he runs down the spiral.   Spike trips and the Crystal Heart falls out of his grasp. Shining Armor picks up the dazed Cadance on his back. She sees Spike and the Heart falling from the tower and spreads her wings. Shining Armor launches his wife into the air like a glider with all his strength, and she catches the Heart and Spike, just in time. As she flies back down to the ground, a Crystal Pony cries, ""Behold! The Crystal Princess!"" She lands among them, smashing the fake heart under her hooves. She firmly says:   She tosses the Heart under the castle, and the snowflake pattern in the center glows bright blue. Two vertical crystal spires come together to keep the Heart in place. The Crystal Ponies regain their crystalline colors and bow to Cadance. Blue light spreads through the streets of the empire. The light suddenly retracts and concentrates inside the Crystal Heart, causing the heart to spin rapidly, generating a sphere of light that explodes and engulfs the empire. Cadance, Shining Armor, the Mane Six, and Spike become colored like the Crystal Ponies. Another, more prolonged, concentrated blast from the Crystal Heart destroys Sombra's physical form and his black crystals, drives back his black clouds, and returns the castle and the Empire to its beautiful appearance. The crystal on top of the castle begins to shine. White light shoots up from the castle's base to the top crystal, and it fires a ribbon of energy into the sky which results in one final, ground-shaking blast of blue light above the empire that disperses the black clouds and dark skies forever. The ribbon radiates into many pink, blue, and yellow ribbons that look similar to the Northern Lights. The ribbons of light are visible from   and Canterlot. In Canterlot Castle, Princess Celestia and   see the ribbons of light and cross their horns with a smile. The Crystal Ponies resume their normal activities. As the royal couple accompany the friends to the train station, Shining Armor jokingly tells Twilight that she has to stop ""saving his rump like this,"" but she reminds him that Spike was the one who did it in the end. Shining tells her that it was just a test and maybe Celestia will just let her retake it, but Cadance touches him with her wing in a 'don't say  !' manner. Twilight remains pessimistic about her meeting with Celestia, leaving her brother and sister-in-law to watch after her with worry.    In the Canterlot castle, Twilight admits to Celestia that she alone wasn't the one who saved the day in the end. Celestia tells her that by choosing to stay in the prison to save time, she put the safety of the Crystal Ponies before her own future. Celestia explains that she would rather have a student who understands self-sacrifice than one who puts her self interests first. Twilight happily announces to her friends that she passed the test, and they all celebrate by singing  . The friends triumphantly leave Canterlot on the Friendship Express. The camera zooms out and settles to show one of the palace balconies.   As Celestia and Luna watch the   depart, Luna magically materializes a spiral-bound book. The princesses look at it, and nod at each other. The book has a dark cover which shows two stars and a swirly pattern. On the train, Spike says that he knew everything was going to be okay and dozes off.      "
"Too Many Pinkie Pies","Dave Polsky","2012-11-17","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Too_Many_Pinkie_Pies"," is the third   of the third season of   and the fifty-fifth episode overall. In this episode, when overwhelmed with having to choose just one friend to spend time with,   uses a     to clone herself, with chaotic results.   Layout supervisor   wrote on   that ""some scenes"" were pulled from the episode,  specifying that no ""major jokes"" were pulled out but that the   ""missed his 'big scene'."" The episode was released on the   a few hours prior to its television premiere on   on November 17, 2012, 10:30 AM Eastern Time. A clip of the opening scene with Pinkie Pie, Twilight, and Spike was dubbed over by   and used to promote the series' season seven premiere on April 13, 2017. Andrea Libman was nominated for a 2013 UBCP/ACTRA Award for ""Best Voice"" for her work in the episode.     The episode starts with   and   outside the cafe seen in  , attempting to turn an apple into an orange. Just as Twilight is about to cast her  ,   appears and gives her a hug around the neck, causing her to shift her aim; the spell ricochets and accidentally hits a bluebird. After a run in with  , Pinkie worries that her friends could be having fun without her and dashes off, briefly visiting   and   and joining them in their respective activities. Pinkie then joins  , who's simply sipping tea with  . Pinkie is relieved but faints due to exhaustion, saying ""fun is hard"" as the scene fades out.   Pinkie Pie begins to feel better after resting in Fluttershy's ""butterfly grove"" and informs the Pegasus of her dilemma. However, Rainbow Dash shows up and invites Pinkie to join her after her weather work while she ""catches some rays"" at the lake. Coincidentally, Applejack invites Pinkie to attend her barn raising, which is scheduled for the same time, but both mares say that that it's simply an open invitation; whether she makes it or not is just fine. Pinkie, not wanting to choose between the two activities, decides to figure out how to race between the swimming hole and the farm the fastest. While doing so, she accidentally jumps on Twilight's back, causing her spell to ricochet again and hit a frog, transforming it into an orange and frog fusion. Explaining to the unicorn that she wants to basically be in two places at once, Twilight laughs and tells her the only way to do that would be if there were more of her to go around. This causes Pinkie to remember the legend of the  , a legendary lake underneath the   that can clone ponies, but she doesn't mention this specific detail to Twilight before she bounces away. Twilight knows of many legends, but is unfamiliar with this one. When Spike asks if this means that her spell practice is over, hoping she'll want to head home so she can do research on the legend, she brightly bursts his bubble. Pinkie ventures into the Everfree Forest as she recalls the story and accompanying rhyme to find the pool, as it was taught to her by her ""Nana Pinkie"", reacting to her echoes and talking to herself. She accidentally falls down a hole in the ground and finds herself in an underground chamber housing the Mirror Pool. Pinkie walks over to the pool and then recites the chant to activate it, while stepping through the pool's surface.  When she emerges, it's shown to not actually be her now climbing out of the water, but her own reflection having been turned into a clone of herself. Pinkie's clone starts shouting, ""Fun! Fun! Fun!"" and Pinkie tells her clone about Applejack and the farm. As they leave the Everfree Forest, Pinkie tells her clone that she has to meet her afterwards so she can tell her all about the fun in as much detail as possible.    Pinkie goes to the lake to meet Rainbow Dash, who had thought she might have gone to the barn raising instead, to which Pinkie replies that she is probably still on her way there. Rainbow scratches her head in confusion. Meanwhile, the Pinkie clone is on the way to the barn raising when she passes by Fluttershy, who calls her over and asks if she would like to come join her picnic with her animal friends. Frantic about having to miss either the barn raising or the picnic, clone Pinkie goes to fetch Pinkie Pie. The clone explains the dilemma, and worriedly concludes that being unable to choose which fun activity to do has left her with having not done anything fun at all.   Pinkie decides the solution is for her and the clone Pinkie to go back to the Mirror Pool, and they duplicate themselves into two more Pinkie Pies. However, the three clone Pinkies decide to clone themselves into six, then twelve, then even more, each clone being less coherent than the last, culminating in a small army of Pinkie Pies who can do nothing more than shout ""Fun!"" repeatedly and wreak havoc. Pinkie Pie tells them to knock it off and to follow her to  . After reassuring them it is fun there, they all hop after her. Pinkie Pie tries to keep them under control, saying they should have every nook in Ponyville covered, and quizzes them on the names of her friends, using a notepad with drawings of Applejack, Fluttershy, and herself. She tells them to fan out on three and begins counting, but they run off before she can say two, leaving her to say ""Good enough.""  Meanwhile, two clones tickle Rainbow Dash and make her sneeze. Rainbow Dash rubs her eyes and looks in shock as the clones wreak havoc by the pond, while the real Pinkie comes along with an inflatable raft, expecting to have fun and relax with her friend, until she sees all her clones. Rainbow Dash hides under her umbrella and chair, saying she doesn't want any more Pinkie Pies as they jump around her. Pinkie, feeling badly, runs off to check up on the barn raising at  . Applejack,  ,   and   are raising the wall of a new barn, and are caught off guard when the Pinkie Pie clones jump around, shouting ""Fun!"" One of them jumps on Big McIntosh, who loses his grip on the rope.  Suddenly having only three ponies on a four-pony job causes the other three to quickly lose their footing and the holds of their ropes. The entire barn framework falls apart. Pinkie Pie shows up and is happy she hasn't missed it, but Applejack angrily tells Pinkie she wants to know where all the Pinkies came from. Pinkie awkwardly runs away, and her clones skip after her as Applejack angrily calls after them to clean up the destruction. Pinkie hides behind a haystack as her clones jump off and tearfully cries out, ""What have I done, what have I done?! My poor friends..."" Outside  , Twilight is telling a mob of angry citizens, who have come to her for a solution, to calm down. Rarity and Fluttershy complain about Pinkies harassing them, causing the yelling to intensify. Twilight says to hold on while she tries to figure something out, rushing back inside with Spike. While they search the shelves for an answer, Spike finds a horseshoe embedded into the back of a bookshelf. He presses it and the back slides upward, revealing a dusty, old book. Twilight reads the book and learns of a spell that can send all the clones back. The only risk is that if they can't identify the real Pinkie Pie, they could send her into the lake by mistake, as the spell cannot tell the difference between a clone and a natural pony.    Twilight and Spike run outside and ask the ponies if they know who the real Pinkie Pie is. The crowd is at a loss of how they could do so. Pinkie arrives and making her way to the front of the crowd, tries to ask Twilight for her help. Twilight tells Pinkie (as a clone runs over and mimics her) that she's not talking to any Pinkie unless she's dealing with the real one. Pinkie protests that she is the real Pinkie, only to have the name set off the clones as they run eagerly to the library and claim that they're the real one. The citizens run back to their homes and lock the doors. Twilight and Spike continue to find a way to send the clones back without sending their friend back in the process. Her very friends' inability to tell one Pinkie from another discourages Pinkie and she becomes depressed. Soon, she cannot tell if she is the real one herself. Twilight and Spike see the depressed Pinkie outside the cafe. Twilight figures that she's not the real one because Pinkie Pie has never sat that long in one place her entire life. As they walk away, Pinkie suggests they use a test to find the real Pinkie by making them do something very simple, but isn't fun at all. The Pinkie that wants to stay badly enough to make it to the end is the real one. Twilight decides that it's a good plan, and goes to implement it. Pinkie is initially thrilled that the problem can be fixed, but soon worries that she won't pass the test and will have to leave her friends. Twilight finds Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Rarity holed up with the woodland creatures until the ""Pinkie storm"" dies down. Twilight has them come with her to help with the plan, while the Apple siblings and their dog   round up all the Pinkies and herd them into the town hall (with the real one being carried in by Rainbow Dash because she was too depressed to come), and Big McIntosh and   shutting them in once their sister enters. Twilight makes the clones quiet down and sit in rows before she announces the test: to their collective horror, it's watching purple paint dry, freshly prepared by Rarity and Fluttershy on a backdrop wall. Nevertheless, the multitude of Pinkies anxiously leans forward when Twilight begins the test, eyes fixed on the paint.   Time passes, and with no sources of stimulation nearby other than the paint, the attention span of the clones begins to flag and break. A clone in the front row looks out the window and says, ""Oh, hey, look at the birdie!"" Twilight instantly zaps her with a beam of magic, inflating her like a balloon and collapsing her into a wisp of pink light that flies to the Everfree Forest and vanishes back into the pool. Unable to withstand the insipid test, another clone calls out to the others to watch her try to bounce and touch the ceiling; Twilight zaps both her and the clone that turns to watch her. Yet another three clones are distracted by the transformed frog with an orange for a body croaking outside the window.

On October 18, 2012,   published an article stating that an upcoming installment of the show deals with the issue of bullying, quoting show head writer   that ""[It] explores how you should handle a bully, and sometimes what the source of bullying is,"" and that ""It's wrapped in a story that's really fun and funny, and has music, and doesn't feel heavy-handed."" , the writer of the episode, revealed that the original working title for the episode was ""Bully For You"". The version of the episode shown on   includes a brief additional sequence at the beginning of the episode. During this sequence, the following text is displayed:  Then a   is very briefly shown, and the episode subsequently begins.     The episode starts out in   with   worrying about what to wear to pick up her cousin,  , at the train station. As time passes by, Apple Bloom starts overreacting and keeps trying on more outfits; finally   tries to drag her along out of the house and to the train station. Apple Bloom, however, manages to escape and continues to search for the right outfit. Then, Applejack states that both Apple Bloom and Babs have something in common; neither pony has a  . As soon as she hears that, Apple Bloom rushes out of the house to have   and   welcome Babs Seed together with her. Apple Bloom brings along Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo to try and persuade Babs Seed to join the  . When Babs arrives at the train station, Apple Bloom rushes up to her and introduces herself and the other members of the CMC. Babs looks overwhelmed and nervous. Scootaloo tells her that they have a big surprise for her, and covers Babs' eyes with her hooves. Later, she takes them away to reveal the Cutie Mark Crusaders' clubhouse. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo act out the ""highlights"" in the clubhouse while Apple Bloom narrates the tour, Babs following along.   Despite the CMC's efforts, Babs seems unimpressed. In an attempt to convince her to join, Scootaloo decides to show Babs the exceptional float they made for the Summer Harvest Parade. Unfortunately, just as Babs is about to say something,   and   intervene, describing the float as ""funny looking"" and call the float a ""lamekin."" The two keep berating the CMC until they cast their eyes upon Babs. Diamond Tiara nudges Silver Spoon, who peers at Babs over the top of her glasses and asks, ""Who's the new blank flank?"" Apple Bloom immediately comes to Babs' aide. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon then heckle Babs, asking her if she's going to join the CMC's club. Babs thinks for a minute before she decides to join Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, abandoning the CMC. Babs then takes the initiative to destroy the CMC's float by kicking off the front wheel. The float rolls out of the barn and down a hill and is smashed to pieces. Babs coolly remarks, ""Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed!"" and Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon laugh. Recognizing Babs as a bully, Sweetie Belle suggests they tell Applejack. However, with Babs threatening retribution if they do so, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom think otherwise. After a   presenting the many different situations where Babs victimizes the Crusaders, the CMC return to the clubhouse. Upon discovering that Babs, Diamond Tiara, and Silver Spoon have occupied the clubhouse, Sweetie Belle bursts into tears. Once again, Sweetie Belle suggests they talk to Applejack, but Apple Bloom diverts this by saying they need to fight back. She plots that they should make Babs the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade. In order to do so, they secretly make a booby-trapped float the night before. Working in the small hours of the morning, they cover the basic frame of a float with paper taken from   and cover the apple-shaped float with luster dust, a golden powder intended for use in cake decorating.    As the Cutie Mark Crusaders are preparing to ride the float in the parade, Babs Seed, Diamond Tiara, and Silver Spoon come up to them. Babs is immediately blown away by the large golden apple float. Sweetie Belle asks, ""Isn't it smashing?"" Realizing that the word ""smashing"" could invoke violence, she begins stuttering, but Scootaloo cuts her off. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon roll their eyes and walk away. Scootaloo warns Babs, telling her not to even think about riding the float, and that she had her chance. Apple Bloom elbows Sweetie Belle, and she leaps into the float to hit the switch to turn it on. After turning the float on, Sweetie Belle sets the kitchen timer with a devious grin. As she is doing that, Apple Bloom drags a mattress and positions it next to the float. Babs sees this as an opportunity to take the float, which she does. She shoves the CMC out of the way as they prepare to step into the float. She yells, ""See ya later, Cutie Mark  !"" and drives off. The CMC get up declaring that stealing the rigged float will teach her to not mess with the CMC. Suddenly Applejack appears, delighted that the CMC are letting Babs ride the float. Apple Bloom agrees, stating that they thought she should be the center of attention. Applejack praises them for their ""good"" deed and making Babs feel special after all of the heartache she had in  . The CMC, who are in anticipation of the upcoming disaster, stop, wide eyed. Applejack explains that she didn't say anything before because she didn't want to single out Babs. She then goes on, explaining that Babs had been getting teased constantly for her blank flank, and that she came to the farm to ""get away from all of her problems back home."" At that, the CMC wilt with a guilty look on their faces. Applejack hands them colorful balloons, then praises them one more time for their ""good deed"" before walking away. The CMC then realize that Babs was bullying them only to avoid being bullied herself like she was in Manehattan. Desperately, the CMC try to find a way to stop the float from tumbling off the edge of the nearby cliff. They rush over to Applejack, and try to explain what they did, but their voices are drowned out by passing instruments in the parade. By riding on  's lettuce float, the CMC gather up enough speed to catch up to the golden apple float before it descends down the cliff and into muddy water. Scootaloo saves Babs by pushing her out of the driver's seat of the float, and the CMC end up falling into the mud at the base of the cliff instead.    When the CMC are washing mud off themselves back at Sweet Apple Acres, Babs expresses her astonishment that the CMC saved her. The CMC regretfully explain how they booby trapped the float in order to get back at her, and became bullies themselves in the process. The CMC and Babs apologize to each other and resolve to ""start over."" The scene changes to the clubhouse, where Sweetie Belle is reading from a scroll on a podium. The CMC swear in Babs as a new member of their club. Before returning to Manehattan, Babs promises to tell   about her own bullies and to start a Manehattan branch of the CMC. When Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon come around, she revokes their friendship in defense of the CMC, exclaiming, ""That's not how you talk to my friends!"" She then threatens to tell Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon's mothers about their attitudes. They fearfully back away and fall in the mud. Babs then gets on the   and departs from   to her home.     "
"Magic Duel","M. A. Larson","2012-12-01","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Duel"," is the fifth   of the third season of   and the fifty-seventh episode overall. In this episode,   returns to   for revenge and defeats   in a magic duel, banishing her from the town.    Show head writer   wrote on Twitter on December 5, 2012 that the episode was submitted on January 27, 2011 and was originally intended to be a season two episode.  After   reported this, layout artist   clarified on Twitter that ""That doesn't mean it takes that long, it means it was originally a script for S2, but things got shuffled & switched.""  Former producer   wrote on Twitter on September 18, 2013, ""Magic Duel was a leftover concept from Season 3. I pulled it because I wanted to do something else with Trixie.""  While the location of the alley and curio shop introduced at the beginning of the episode is not specified in the show, one of the show's layout artists who worked on the episode recalls the script identifying it as  . In early 2012, a blog titled ""phils portfolio"" posted production art of the alley and curio shop, each in both sketched and finished forms.  The file name of the alley sketch identifies them as being part of Canterlot. The post was taken down from the blog within a few days after the episode aired. At the 2012  , Hasbro Studios' vice president of development Michael Vogel hinted that   would be returning in the third season, saying, ""I think we're not allowed to say, but I can tell you that I would expect, uh, come season three, we'll maybe see some great and powerful stuff"" in answer to a question about Trixie and  . When the episode's writer was asked about the origin of the name ""Alicorn Amulet"", he replied that it was called the ""Unicharm"" in all of the episode's scripts, but ""someone somewhere along the way changed it to Alicorn"".   At one point,   had the line ""Madness!"" after Trixie turned her dress a combination of army green and neon yellow before   ushered Rarity away like  .  A scene including the line ""Stop that"" spoken by   was cut from the episode;  despite not having a speaking role in the final version of the episode, the Mayor is still listed in its credits.   mentions in an interview that a few of his jokes were cut from the episode, for example Trixie asks to see the ""revenge section"" of the curio shop and the shopkeeper replies ""oh, right over here.""  Holly Giesbrecht wrote on Twitter that ""a few"" of her layout scenes were cut.    One rainy night, a hooded mare gallops into an empty marketplace and enters a darkened curio shop. She begins to rummage around the shop until a small candle is lit. A stallion, who is the shopkeeper, comes out and asks if he can help her. Stepping behind the counter, he surmises that something powerful drew the customer to his shop; she points to an amulet inlaid with a crimson gem kept under glass on the shelf behind him. The shopkeeper identifies it as the "" "", describing it as one of the most mysterious and powerful   charms. When she indicates that this is what she's looking for, he warns her that the amulet is far too dangerous, but is quickly convinced to sell when she tosses a big bag of gold   onto the counter.  The mare walks slowly to the amulet and an evil smile is reflected onto the glass dome.    In  ,   and   are over at  's cottage. Some of Fluttershy's   friends are there, and Fluttershy tries to tell them not to be scared but gives Twilight a sudden warning if anything happens to them. Spike tries to calm the yellow pegasus, but she is frantic about the safety of her animal friends. However, the animals appear to be excited about helping Twilight with her trick. Twilight assures Fluttershy that it will be okay and uses her magic to lift the animals. The animals glow with Twilight's magic and fly in the air while Fluttershy starts biting her hooves. The animals happily fly around in the air in the shape of an infinity symbol, and safely land on the ground. The magic trick is revealed to be practice in anticipation of  's visit with delegates from Saddle Arabia, and Twilight is in charge of the entertainment. Suddenly,   zooms in and crashes into Twilight. She looks frantic about something and asks Twilight to come with her because it's an emergency.   When Twilight races into town, she spots the hooded mare introduced at the start of the episode. The mare zaps  , spawning a brown dress, which Rarity points out that the shades are used for accents. She faints as   catches her on her back and walks away with  . As Twilight and Spike enter the scene, the mystery mare removes her hood and reveals herself to be  , with the Alicorn Amulet displayed around her neck. Rainbow Dash begins to mock Trixie's magic skills, but she casts a spell on Dash, causing one of her wings to enlarge and making her lose balance. However,   and   still remain loyal to Trixie, but that does not move her. She fuses the two colts by the tips of their horns.   Twilight demands Trixie to stop harassing her friends. She refuses and conjures a screen showing her life following her humiliation in the episode  . It shows her wagon having been vandalized, dirtied with thrown tomatoes and eggs and the picture of a crudely drawn  , complete with baby bottle, as well as an ""X"" across her   sign on the wagon. In the next flashback, a group of ponies laughs at her as she tries to perform her ""teleportation spell"" to run away. Another flashback shows Trixie working on Pinkie's family rock farm just to earn a living. Pinkie interrupts her, stating that she was lucky her family would hire somepony like her. Trixie then uses a spell and removes Pinkie's muzzle, preventing the pony from talking. Trixie vengefully challenges Twilight to a duel, but the purple unicorn declines. Trixie continues doing unkind things to convince her to say yes, such as turning Spike into a basketball, uprooting   and throwing Twilight's books out, whom her owl,  , tries to grab. Twilight finally agrees to the duel. Trixie then removes all the spells she made, except Pinkie's mouth.  Trixie makes the first move and blasts a heavy cart loaded with two barrels of apples into the air. Ponies scramble out of the way from where it's going to crash, but   trips and is in danger of being crushed. Twilight takes control of the cart in time and sets it and its contents right again, just as Trixie hurls six large pies at her. Thinking quickly, Twilight conjures a  , which immediately gobbles up the incoming pies. The creature burps up another parasprite, but Twilight removes both of them before they can reproduce again. She has barely recovered from the magical exertion when Trixie drops a large sheet of snow on Twilight and the vicinity. Twilight easily melts the snow and shoots a beam of magic at her opponent, causing a long mustache to grow on her face. Twilight's friends laugh and Trixie haughtily snips her facial hair off with conjured scissors. She then summons Snips and Snails, who fearfully bow to her. She suddenly zaps them with a helical ribbon of red magic that lifts them into the air. When they fall back to earth, Snips has become a wailing   and Snails has become a withered elderly pony. Twilight is shocked because only ""the highest level unicorns"" can perform age spells. She determinedly tries to reverse the age spell, but the power required is beyond her capabilities. Trixie promptly banishes her from town. Before Spike and her friends can join her, Trixie conjures a large glass dome that seals off Ponyville.   Just outside the  , Twilight sweats over a flower, trying to de-age it to budding stage. At first she seems to have succeeded, but the second her magic lets go, it immediately returns to its natural age. Frustrated, she wonders how Trixie could know such advanced magic, and without Spike's magic flame, she can't message  , who is still in  , for help. Considering who else she knows with knowledge of strange and powerful magic, she seeks the help of  . The zebra promises to teach her more advanced magic so she can evict Trixie. Meanwhile, in Ponyville, Trixie has forced the citizens to become her slaves, and has conjured bad weather inside the glass dome. In the  , she forces Rarity to make banners showing her likeness, while  , Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy hang them up. Trixie rudely tells   to hurry up with her throne, which is made out of sweets (which baby   is sitting on). Applejack must hoof-press apples so Trixie can enjoy an applesauce facial. When Applejack refuses to do anything until Twilight is allowed back into town, Trixie conjures two feathers that tickle Applejack until she agrees to keep on working, and then hurls her into a pile of bushels full of apples. Trixie also forces Pinkie Pie to dance for her own entertainment. Rarity complains that Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville; downcast, she loses her concentration and the needle she is using pokes her in the hoof.   In the forest, Twilight is concentrating on levitating three spheres of water around herself as she magically stands on the surface of a pool. Zecora balances herself on one leg as she recites, ""No noise, no sound, no din, no fuss, must interfere with your focus. Unlearn what you have learned, only then can victory be earned."" Twilight, however, cannot focus because she can't stop thinking about Trixie's victory. She drops the water spheres and falls through the pool surface. Zecora states that Twilight must readjust her thinking before she can learn any of her lessons. When given the chance, the friends and Spike pour over dozens of Twilight's books, and Fluttershy finds one that has information about the Alicorn Amulet, but because of her quiet nature, she is outspoken by her friends. Finally, Spike takes the book from her and they read about the amulet. The book says that the wearer of the amulet gains amazing magical power, but it also corrupts the user to evil the more he or she uses it. In addition to this, due to a magical lock the only pony who can take the amulet off is the wearer. The friends convince a terrified Fluttershy to sneak out of the dome and contact Twilight. Rarity is inspired to create a ""dangerous mission"" outfit for her. Trixie is next seen riding a large wooden sleigh, which Snips and Snails (their ages back to normal) are laboriously pulling through the grass. Trixie even has a whip that she isn't afraid to use, and she is angry that somepony set off the magic force field. Snips points out that pulling the sleigh would be easier if it had wheels, to which Trixie says, ""the Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't trust wheels,"" and Snails comments that Trixie is getting ""weirder and weirder."" They come across three irritated beavers who are whacking the dome with their tails. When Trixie asks them what they are doing, one of the beavers angrily chatters, emphatically gesticulates towards a log, and then the dome: they're trying to bring the log home, but the dome is in the way. Trixie rolls her eyes and lifts the dome so they can leave with the log. She then transforms the wooden sleigh to an elaborate golden bed, which Snips and Snails have to drag back. Making sure that Trixie is far enough away, the beavers drag Fluttershy out of the hollow log. Fluttershy, who is wearing the ""dangerous mission"" outfit complete with bunny ears, is petrified at the prospect of having to look for Twilight in the  . It takes half a dozen birds to drag her away from the safety of the log and towards the forest.    After Fluttershy reunites with Twilight at Zecora's hut and informs her about the Alicorn Amulet, they discuss ways to beat Trixie at her own game. Zecora says that while she has learned all of her lessons, Twilight needs to ""use the six"". After figuring out the meaning of Zecora's words, Twilight writes a letter and sends Fluttershy back into Ponyville.  Twilight and Zecora arrive at Ponyville's outskirts, where she meets up with Trixie through the glass dome. Twilight states she knows about the Alicorn Amulet and that Trixie cheated, but Trixie denies her accusation. Twilight then reveals that she was given a green amulet of her own from Zecora, bragging about how her amulet is ""from beyond the Everfree Forest"" and ""way more powerful"" than the Alicorn Amulet. Trixie scoffs at this claim, so Twilight preposes a rematch to prove it. Trixie points out that there's no need as she already beat Twilight, but Twilight casually baits her and says that she'll never get to see the ""totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest"" as she and Zecora begin to walk away. Unable to stand not knowing, Trixie dispels the giant dome and teleports over to them, begrudgingly accepting the challenge. Trixie performs yet another ""simple"" age spell, as she would call it, on Snips and Snails, transforming them both into foals. Twilight calls forth Rarity and Applejack, casting her own age spell on them. She continuously makes the two ponies different ages, between young and old and back again, and Trixie gapes in awe, declaring it as impossible. Then, Twilight creates a duplicate of Rainbow Dash, and ""grants"" Pinkie Pie the ability to simultaneously play ten instruments. She even turns Applejack into a stallion.   Completely defeated, Trixie can do nothing but stare on in horror, with no way of making a comeback. When Twilight brags that her amulet is stronger than Trixie's, Trixie uses her magic to snatch it. Declaring that with it she'll rule all of   with it, she takes off the Alicorn Amulet, its evil magic sputtering out, and puts on the green one. One of the Rainbow Dashes then nabs the Alicorn Amulet. Trixie at first protests, then remembers that she has Twilight's amulet now and fires a beam at Rainbow to make her writhe in agony, but it only tickles her. Proclaiming the new amulet to be defective, she demands the Alicorn Amulet back, but Rainbow says that the amulet is going back into hiding where it belongs, placing it in a small lock box held by Zecora. Twilight then reveals that the amulet Trixie stole from her is merely ""one of Zecora's doorstops"", just as it falls to the ground and shatters. Twilight explains to Trixie that all of her ""advanced magic spells"" were actually common magic tricks and illusions. In a flashback, Fluttershy gathers her friends and their families to read out Twilight's plan. In another that takes place in Carousel Boutique, Applejack begins to paint   orange to recreate her filly self as Pinkie Pie paints   and gives him Applejack's cutie mark to produce a stallion version of Applejack. Rarity dyes and combs  's hair to make her look like Rarity as a filly. Fluttershy adjusts her Rainbow Dash wig in a mirror and exchanges a smile with  , who has also been painted and disguised to look like an elderly Applejack. When Twilight was ""casting"" her spells during the duel, the different ages of Applejack and Rarity hid behind a nearby statue and revealed themselves in turn, creating the illusion of an effortless age spell. As the flashback plays, Twilight tells Trixie how she used a different kind of magic – the magic of friendship – to take on the Alicorn Amulet. When Trixie confusedly inquires about the pony with the ten instruments, Twilight cheerfully states it was not magic, but rather it was just Pinkie's sheer skill as performer, not unlike her one-pony band role in  . The ponies then cheer at Twilight's victory against Trixie as the dark clouds looming over Ponyville disappear.    In the next scene under the starry night sky, Princess Celestia and the two delegates from Saddle Arabia are watching Twilight's magic performance, in which she once again levitates Fluttershy's animal friends in an infinity symbol. Fluttershy finds it nerve-wracking and Spike tries to comfort her as Twilight puts on her show for the delegates. But as she places the animals down, she realizes that Trixie was adding fancy fireworks to the background. As Trixie puts her cape and hat on, she says that it was the least she could do after treating Twilight's friends and neighbors so horribly, recognizing that the amulet had been affecting her behavior. She then sincerely apologizes to Twilight for her vengeful ways, and Twilight accepts her apology. Trixie proudly asks her if ""the Great and Apologetic Trixie"" is the ""most magnificent humble pony"" she has ever seen. Twilight just smiles and shakes her head and Trixie leaves in a puff of smoke. As she canters away, she trips and falls, then gets up and keeps running. Before the iris out swallows the screen, Pinkie breaks the fourth wall again by jumping through the iris out and gesticulating towards her still-sealed mouth. Twilight uses magic to open a slit in the black screen and restore Pinkie's mouth. As Pinkie inhales deeply to speak, the credits immediately start playing.     "

All the ponies except Rainbow Dash meet up at the edge of the woods. Rainbow Dash meets them at their first campsite. Rainbow Dash tells Scootaloo that they will be sharing a tent. At night, Rainbow tells the ponies a scary campfire story about  . Much of it is told offscreen. When she finishes, Rainbow Dash imitates The Olden Pony and asks, ""Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"" She scares the Crusaders by shouting that they do. Scootaloo mocks their fear while badly concealing her own in an attempt to impress Rainbow. Rainbow Dash leaves Scootaloo outside the tent. Scootaloo’s fears become more real when she is alone. She quickly enters the tent and falls asleep. Scootaloo “wakes up” when she hears a pony's voice outside. When she exits the tent, Applejack and Rarity's tents are gone. Scootaloo runs out of the clearing. When she looks back, she sees The Olden Pony following her.   Scootaloo slows down and comes face-to-face with The Olden Pony when she turns around. When the pony asks about her horseshoe, Scootaloo gallops back to the campsite. On the way back, she sees   in the trees. Scootaloo returns to the tent and finds that The Olden Pony has taken Rainbow Dash’s place. Scootaloo wakes up from the nightmare and attempts to prevent herself from going back to sleep.   In the morning, Scootaloo suffers from lack of sleep. However, she lies to Rainbow, saying that the previous night was the ""best night ever.""   Scootaloo sleeps in the cart as the ponies continue traveling. She wakes up when Applejack mentions that they may not reach the campsite before dark. Scootaloo rushes to check the path ahead and pokes fun at her fellow Crusaders' fear. Scootaloo has a difficult time staying awake when traveling ahead on the path. She eventually returns to the other ponies. Worried, Applejack walks with Scootaloo, who is extremely jumpy. Scootaloo denies Applejack's concerns and moves away to pull the cart. The ponies stop for the night in a large cave, and Scootaloo collects firewood. She only gathers a small amount because she is frightened by eyes she sees in the forest. At the campfire, Scootaloo unsuccessfully attempts to tell a happy story. Rainbow tells the story of   despite Applejack’s interjections. When Rainbow finishes, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle are frightened by the sparks from the fire. However, they quickly realize there's nothing to be afraid of.   Scootaloo suggests singing campfire songs to stall before bedtime. Sweetie Belle sings ""Ninety-nine buckets of oats on the wall."" When she finishes, the ponies go inside the cave to sleep. Scootaloo continues to find alternatives to sleeping, such as a dance competition or game of hide-and-seek. Applejack attributes this to Scootaloo's desire to spend time with Rainbow Dash.    In her dream, Scootaloo is pursued by The Headless Horse’s hoofsteps in a forest. The Headless Horse approaches her when she falls down a hill. However, Princess Luna appears and banishes the Horse. She explains that it is her duty as the princess of the night to step into ponies' dreams. Luna tells Scootaloo that when she wakes up, her greatest fear will still exist. Scootaloo admits that she is afraid that Rainbow Dash will find out that she was scared by the campfire stories. Luna says that everypony must face his or her fears. Scootaloo is uncertain, but the dream begins to dissipate.  Once awake, Scootaloo is still scared by Rainbow Dash's story of The Headless Horse. She leaves on her scooter when she mistakes Rainbow Dash's snoring for the Horse's whinnying. She slides down a hill and toward a river canyon when her scooter hits a rock. When she falls into the river, it carries her toward a waterfall.   Rainbow Dash saves her as she falls over the waterfall and asks why she was outside. Encouraged by Princess Luna’s silhouette in the moon, Scootaloo admits that she was scared and why she pretended to be brave. Rainbow Dash says that she was also scared when she first heard those stories. She promises to take Scootaloo under her wing, and the two hug. The next day, the ponies reach the Winsome Falls, large waterfalls of liquid rainbow. When the other ponies start a race, Rainbow and Scootaloo fly after them together.    In a dreamscape forest, The Olden Pony asks Scootaloo for her rusty horseshoe. Scootaloo resolves to face her fear.

Rainbow Dash is confident that she will be accepted, while   is far more nervous. When the letter arrives, Rainbow Dash seizes the letter from the mailpony. She quickly reads it and sadly announces, ""I... didn't get in."" Her friends gasp in dismay, but she cries, ""Gotcha!"" and shows them the green check mark on the letter. Pinkie Pie abruptly embraces Rainbow Dash and clings to her tightly, exclaiming how happy she is for her with a bone-crushing hug. When Rainbow Dash departs to the Academy for a week's stay, Pinkie pulls out a massive megaphone and shouts: "" "" The volume of the exclamation echoes in the mountain scenery around them, though Pinkie Pie worriedly asks her friends, ""Do you think she heard me?""   Rainbow Dash arrives at the  . She stands in line with seven other  , some of whom appeared in  , such as   and  . Wonderbolt captain  , in dress uniform instead of her flightsuit and a whistle around her neck, walks past the candidates and emphatically tells them they do   have what it takes to become an elite flier. When Spitfire tries to intimidate Rainbow Dash, the latter confidently declares, ""I'd never quit, ma'am!"" bringing out a smile of approval from the captain. The next pony in line,  , is eager to prove her worth, prompting Spitfire to command the fliers to fly five hundred laps. Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust equal each other in their speed, easily outstripping the other Pegasi. They learn each other's names and agree to go to the mess hall. Outside   in  , Pinkie Pie is eagerly checking her mailbox every few seconds, looking sad when it remains empty.   tells her Rainbow Dash has not been gone for twenty-four hours yet, and tells her to give Rainbow time to settle in. Applejack suggests that they should go and watch   practice some new spells assigned by  , but Pinkie is not persuaded and remains by her letterbox, continuing checking its contents once every few seconds.     Back at the Wonderbolt Academy, Rainbow Dash and the other seven Pegasi are now wearing cadet flightsuits, and are apparently training together as part of the same cadet class. Spitfire unveils a contraption called the Dizzitron, a spin-out simulator. The Dizzitron works by spinning the Pegasus around in circles, disorientating him or her. The Pegasi's task is to recover quickly from the ""spin-out"" upon being released from the contraption, fly in a straight line as soon as possible, and come in for a smooth landing. Although Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust volunteer to go first when Spitfire asks, it was apparently a rhetorical question as she chooses in order of line up. The first mare to go on the Dizzitron is completely winded and almost crashes in front of Spitfire, who says that the mare's time of fifteen seconds is decent. Rainbow Dash is next in line and effectively returns to Spitfire in six seconds, setting a new Academy record. The first mare tells her admiringly that she made it look so easy, to which Rainbow grins back and says that's because she makes   look easy. Third in line, Lightning Dust flies up to the Dizzitron and requests Spitfire to set the Dizzitron on maximum speed in order to test her limits. Spitfire permits this, and despite the increased difficulty, Lightning Dust manages to return in six and a half seconds.  After the whole class have had their turn, Spitfire announces she will be pairing them up for the rest of the camp, with one cadet being a lead pony and the other being a wingpony; she will post the team assignments in the morning.  Rainbow Dash assumes that she will be the lead pony of her pairing, but when she checks the posting in the mess hall at breakfast, she is disappointed to find that while Lightning Dust is her partner, she was assigned to be wingpony instead. In her office, Spitfire is stamping a stack of Wonderbolts posters with a horseshoe-shaped stamp when Rainbow Dash enters and asks her about this decision. Spitfire tells her that she paired them together because she believes they'd make an unstoppable team.  However, Rainbow expresses her thoughts that while that's likely true, she feels that she deserves to be lead pony. Spitfire then explains that she gave Lightning Dust the lead position because Lightning Dust likes to push herself, a little more so than Rainbow Dash does. Rainbow is of course still disappointed, but acquiesces to Spitfire's decision and leaves.   The next day, Lightning Dust shows Rainbow Dash her golden lead pony badge, which she secures on her chest.  Rainbow is still feeling a bit down about being wingpony, but that's the extent of it.  The class is divided into two teams of four, red and blue, and are told that the team which captures the most flags of the opposing team's color wins.  Additionally, the pairs of lead pony and wingpony must remain together or be disqualified, which would effectively cut a team from four ponies to only two.  In the process, Rainbow Dash spots the first flag in a narrow ravine, which has two logs closely placed across the top, making the approach much tighter. Lightning Dust determinedly drives forward, ignoring Rainbow's observation that if they were to continue to fly at this speed into the ravine, both would not be able to fit at the same time. Lightning Dust pushes ahead; as she must keep up or disqualify the two of them, Rainbow flies right behind her as she already knows that they will have to enter one after the other. However, with Lightning Dust's body in the way, she can't see exactly how tight a squeeze it's going to be. Consequently, as Lightning Dust flies into the ravine first, she tucks in her wings to avoid grazing the logs, but since Rainbow can't see, she keeps her wings open and her right wing clips a log, injuring it. The two then return the flag to Spitfire, though Rainbow is now lagging a bit and is hesitant to immediately continue due to her injured wing. Lightning Dust chooses to ignore her partner's injury. Pressured by the expectant Spitfire and Lightning Dust, Rainbow obliges to continue in the exercise. Back in Ponyville, Pinkie Pie is still in front of her mailbox, though her mane looks disheveled and unkempt.  ,  , Applejack, and Twilight are watching her from a distance. Pinkie is distraught that it has been three days and Rainbow Dash still has not sent a letter yet. Twilight suggests Pinkie Pie send a letter to Rainbow herself. Though Pinkie embraces the idea at first, she becomes paranoid and is terrified by the possibility that Rainbow has forgotten them already. Pinkie enumerates other possibilities, such as the letter being lost in the mail or another pony receiving the letter. She ultimately decides to send a care package to Rainbow in person. The friends agree, though Pinkie advises them, ""Don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first. It might take a while for her to get her memory back.""    Back at the Wonderbolts Academy, Spitfire instructs the Pegasi to fly their famous air obstacle course, which challenges their precision and ability to adapt in different weather environments.  She adds that as this is not a race, to not worry about winning, however Lightning Dust winks at Rainbow Dash, implying that she's going to do just that anyway.  Held up behind another pair, Lightning Dust expresses frustration that they can't get around them.  Rainbow attempts to mollify her partner, pointing out that they can show off their synchronized flying to Spitfire instead; Lightning Dust grudgingly agrees. Flying behind the same pair in the midst of a stormy setting, Lightning Dust impatiently mutters, ""What are they, a couple of snails? It's just a little weather."" Once the air clears however, Lightning Dust grabs the opportunity to carelessly soar past them, tossing the rest of the pairs aside in a spin-out. Commending their record time, which does please Rainbow Dash, Spitfire gives Lightning Dust and Rainbow an early leave to the mess hall. When she leaves to help sort out the other teams affected by Lightning Dust's recklessness though, Rainbow expresses her discomfort to her partner, saying, ""Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that."" Lightning Dust rebuts, ""Hey, you snooze, you lose!"" The last straw comes in a training exercise where the pairs are required to clear clouds from the sky. Even though Rainbow Dash points out that the pair are way ahead, Lightning Dust proposes that they work together to make a tornado, a tactic that will blow away their competition. Recalling Spitfire's comment that Lightning Dust pushes herself more, Rainbow agrees to the plan. Though the tornado is initially successful in clearing the clouds, Lightning Dust loses control of it and the tornado ends up whirling off-course. At this moment, Rainbow's friends show up in the   to deliver the care package.   They get sucked in, and the lines connecting the hot air balloon's basket to the balloon are snapped by the tornado's winds, sending the friends through the air. Rainbow sees them and quickly corrals some clouds to cushion their fall. She then releases the cloud, propelling the friends back into the air, where they are safely caught by the other Pegasi, Rarity gratefully embracing Thunderlane, and Fluttershy awkwardly detaches herself from Cloudchaser's grasp, annoying Cloudchaser. As the rest of her class and other cadets gather around, Rainbow touches down on the plateau to determine whether or not her friends are okay, and goes to check on Pinkie Pie, who is absolutely overjoyed that she still remembers her.  Lightning Dust triumphantly exclaims, ""That... was...  !"" but Rainbow Dash is enraged that her friends were put in mortal peril. Lightning Dust shows an appalling lack of concern for Rainbow's friends or their classmates, only caring about how many clouds the tornado took out, an attitude that the surrounding cadets are shocked and offended by. Lightning Dust even has the gall to extend for a hoofbump, but Rainbow Dash pushes down her hoof and goes on to criticize Lightning Dust's poor judgment during the previous exercises. Rainbow fully understands the need to be the best, but Lightning Dust is trying to be the best in all the wrong ways. Lightning Dust retorts that her results are apparently what the Wonderbolts are looking for, as Spitfire had made her the leader of their pair, to which Rainbow Dash grimly agrees. Rainbow pays another visit to Spitfire's office and informs her of Lightning Dust's decision to use a tornado to bust the clouds. While effective, Rainbow is upset that the tornado nearly took out her friends. She declares that there is a difference between pushing oneself as hard as one can and being reckless. She states that she doesn't want to be part of the Wonderbolts Academy if they reward recklessness, like Lightning Dust had displayed. Turning in her wingpony badge onto the stunned Spitfire's desk, Rainbow quits the Academy, and her friends comfort her on the field. Rarity exclaims in confusion that being a Wonderbolt was Rainbow Dash's dream, but Rainbow replies it isn't anymore.    Nonetheless, before she can leave, Spitfire (a little ticked off that Rainbow didn't give her a chance to respond) catches up to her and affirms her argument. She goes on to say that while they do want the best flyers in Equestria, Rainbow was correct about the well-being of other ponies being ahead of recklessness, and pushing themselves must always be in the right direction. The two Academy staff members who have been assisting Spitfire throughout the episode then bring over Lightning Dust, from whom Spitfire literally rips the lead pony badge off, stripping her of her position as lead pony, and sends her away. As Lightning Dust sadly walks away, escorted by Spitfire's two assistants, Spitfire gives the badge to Rainbow Dash and tells her that she's no wingpony, but a leader. Rainbow reacts by repetitively saying, ""Oh my gosh!"" and fluttering her wings in exultation.  As soon as Spitfire gives Rainbow her orders, she flies up to the rest of her class, who salute her as a leader. Rainbow guides them into the sunlight, while the rest of her friends watch from below. Pinkie Pie yells after Rainbow Dash, ""Wait! You didn't even get to open your care package!""       "

According to storyboard artist  , the two shooting stars represent Applejack's  .     In the   barn,   and   are taking out family heirlooms from boxes.   is sorting through dozens of RSVPs for the upcoming   reunion, sent from family members living in Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain,  , Tall Tale Town, and  . Apple Bloom is particularly excited to see   again. Granny is surprised that so many relatives will be coming, and says that they might need a bigger cider trough.   Since Granny has gotten “a little rustier in the giddy-up” since the last reunion, she allows Applejack to take charge of organizing the reunion. Granny shows Applejack and Apple Bloom a photo album with pictures of past reunions, where ponies worked on an old quilt, made apple fritters, ran seven-legged races, and took big family photos. Applejack makes mental note of the supplies needed for these activities. Granny says that the entire family will be coming this time, and not everypony might have time to attend the next reunion. Applejack promises to make this “the most memorable reunion” they've ever had.   That night, Applejack can’t fall asleep because she is still anxious about the reunion, and Apple Bloom can’t fall asleep because she is excited about hanging out with Babs. Applejack gets her second wind, realizing the responsibility that Granny Smith has entrusted her with, and continues brainstorming. Apple Bloom falls asleep on the bed, and Applejack tucks her in, saying the reunion will be worth the wait.    The next morning, Applejack pulls Apple Bloom out of bed, saying they don't have much time; preparations for the reunion are underway. They join   and harvest apples by bucking trees. Applejack collects rolls of fabric from  , jars of honey and glitter from  , and buckets of rainwater with assistance from  . Big McIntosh chops logs for firewood, and Applejack (with help from  ) lights a fire under a row of cauldrons of cooking oil. The last of the decorations is put up just as the family arrives on foot and in pony-drawn wagons, carriages, coaches, and zeppelins. Granny Smith hugs her cousin Apple Rose, and dozens of Apple family members exchange similar warm greetings. Among those present are   from  , and   from  . Applejack uses a megaphone to welcome the family and give a rundown of the first couple of activities. In the crowd, Babs Seed surprises Apple Bloom and the two start chatting, but Applejack butts in and eagerly shows them the elaborate seven-legged race and obstacle course. The fillies doubt they will have time to catch up while racing against their other cousins, but Applejack urges them to “make some memories” during the race.   Applejack goes to check on the quilt. Granny Smith, her cousin Apple Rose, and Auntie Applesauce are reminiscing when Applejack tells them that she replaced their traditional rocking chairs with sewing machines. The three elderly mares are put off by the sudden change, but Applejack insists that they can finish the quilt that they’ve been working on for many reunions. The elderly mares start sewing, but the sewing machines are too deafening to permit conversation. Meanwhile, Apple Bloom and Babs try to catch up, but are too occupied with the race's complicated legs. Applejack checks on the ponies making apple fritters and tells them to pick up the pace, leaving no time to socialize. Everypony except Applejack is becoming aware that very little fun is being had at this reunion.   When Applejack   calls for a break, the quilt is practically an acre long, enough fritters have been made to feed all of Ponyville, and everypony is utterly exhausted. Applejack wants to take some photos for Granny Smith's album, but sees that no one is having much fun. She organizes a hayride around the farm (once again preventing Apple Bloom and Babs from hanging out) and, in an effort to shake things up, makes the ride much faster than expected. The wagon barrels down the road toward Sweet Apple Acres' west orchard where, according to Granny Smith,   has taken up residence. Applejack bucks an apple tree and stirs those ""somethings"" from their sleep: fruit bats of assorted colors. They fly over the wagon and form a rainbow across the sky that impresses the family members. But disaster quickly strikes when the fruit bats notice the apples in Auntie Applesauce's hat. They swoop down and cause the wagon to swerve off the road. The ponies riding in the wagon jump ship just before the runaway wagon crashes into the barn, completely destroying it. Realizing what a mess of things she's made, Applejack hides her face in teary shame.   Applejack tearfully looks at the ruins of the barn, lamenting that everything is ruined. She apologizes to Granny Smith for ruining the reunion, but Granny tells her that she had everypony ""so caught up in all the doin'"" that they were unable to simply enjoy each other's company. Even then, Applejack remarks that the only thing anypony will remember is that it was the worst of all reunions. Granny assures her that there's still time to make good memories. Applejack recalls that at the end of each reunion there was an Apple family photo taken in front of the barn, but the barn is no longer there. Applejack announces she has one more activity to remember for the right reasons.   Applejack rallies the family together with   as they work together to rebuild the barn from the ground up. Unlike the previous activities, however, everypony has fun working and dancing together. At the song's end, the ponies gather before the newly finished barn for the family photo, and the reunion closes on a high note. Apple Bloom and Babs say their goodbyes, and Granny congratulates Applejack on a job well done.    That evening, Applejack writes her   to  . She writes that when you're with family, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable because the simplest activities will be meaningful.

A clip was released by   a day before the episode's scheduled airing.  The episode was released on the   hours before the scheduled airing. The timberwolves, except for the big one, were modeled and animated with 3D cel-shaded graphics  (instead of Adobe Flash) by John Cantlie  in  . When asked about the Dragon Code, Dave Polsky admitted that   had shown Spike knew little about being a dragon but ""[I] felt it credible he'd taken initiative to learn about his dragon heritage since"". In the episode's early stages, it was a Rarity and Spike episode. However, it was re-written because Rarity was too mean to Spike in the original script. The final version uses Applejack instead.     The episode opens at  's   in  .   has assigned twelve books for Twilight to read over the course of a weekend. Realizing how busy such an assignment will be keeping her, Twilight gives   the day off. Spike jumps at the chance to do things he's been wanting to do, such as touching his nose with his tongue, playing bongos on his belly and smelling his own feet, but quickly runs out of things to do when it turns out he's not as good at putting together to-do lists as Twilight is.   Bored, Spike wanders through Ponyville for a bit before deciding to take a ride in the  . In his excitement though, he accidentally undoes the balloon's rope tether, and it takes off without him. He chases the runaway hot air balloon across Ponyville, nearly crashing into   in the process, and eventually catches it as it floats over the  . Spike re-tethers the balloon to the ground before realizing where he's ended up. The horrors of the Everfree Forest are quickly made apparent to Spike, and he's confronted by a pack of three  . They chase him through the forest and soon corner him. Just before the timberwolves can make a quick meal out of the dragon, however,   comes to the rescue. She distracts the beasts so that Spike can get away, and the timberwolves chase after her. Applejack, proving to be far more resourceful than Spike, dispatches the wolves and leaves them as piles of leaves and tree bark. Spike marvels at Applejack's skills and thanks her immensely for saving his life. It turns out that Applejack was in the Everfree Forest because she'd seen the runaway hot air balloon and came to investigate. With the balloon retrieved, Applejack and Spike leave the forest together. Behind them, the shattered remains of the timberwolves   come alive.   Applejack thanks Spike for walking her home and goes to see to her chores. Still thankful to her for saving his life, Spike offers to do Applejack's chores for her. She initially turns down his gesture, dismissing her actions as something friends do for each other, but relents when Spike is insistent. Finally, Applejack tells Spike that he can help   with whatever she needs. Spike ends up helping Apple Bloom wash a dirty pig. At first, Spike's services—while somewhat clumsy—are indeed helpful, as far as Apple Bloom is concerned. But as time goes by, and Spike becomes ever more determined to assist, and as a result, large messes are made. Applejack once again tries to send Spike on his way, but the little dragon will hear none of it, explaining that his intent to help is part of his 'dragon code'; he owes his   to Applejack. Granny Smith mentions Twilight, and Spike comes to a realization: he has to ""break the news"" to her. He returns to the library and finds Twilight studying. He explains to her that Applejack saved his life and that, according to his dragon code, he must now serve her for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, Twilight did not pay any attention due to her obsession with studying and simply said ""Mhm"". Heartbroken and teary-eyed, he leaves to start his new life at Sweet Apple Acres. Applejack and Granny Smith are beyond surprised to hear that Twilight's given Spike her ""blessing"", and Spike, still committed to serving Applejack, proceeds to make a mess in the kitchen that Applejack and Granny Smith just got through cleaning. The two look to each other in profound worry.   Applejack explains to Spike that she respects his adhering to his dragon code, but she's uncomfortable with his devout servitude to her. Spike disputes that the dragon code is a part of him, that he must be true to himself, and that defying it means he's no longer a ""noble dragon"". Applejack has no intention of belittling Spike's integrity and quickly looks for something for him to do—something that won't end up with him making a mess or getting himself hurt. They decide to take the pie he helped make to  .   Rarity eyes the pie Applejack and Spike brought her with a wince, but a facial cue from Applejack tells her she shouldn't disappoint him. She samples the pie (which, judging from her expression, is clearly inedible), and Spike—at Applejack's behest—excuses himself to do Rarity's dishes. Applejack gives Rarity the full story: she saved Spike's life from timberwolves, and now he's forever indebted to her. Instead of being sympathetic to Applejack's plight, Rarity expresses envy. This sentiment doesn't last long, as Spike quickly makes a mess of Rarity's kitchen as well, to which Applejack comments ""sometimes Spike's help isn't that helpful"". It's at this time that   makes her entrance and is too given an explanation of Applejack's predicament. Rainbow believes she has the solution: task Spike with something exceedingly difficult and drive him to quit. She gives Spike such a task: build a large tower of rocks for Rainbow Dash to smash through. Believing this to be a request of Applejack's, Spike naturally accepts. To Rainbow Dash's surprise though, he   give up, and ends up stacking a large tower of rocks as requested. Rainbow Dash follows through on her bluff and brings the tower down, leaving her in a daze. With that done, Applejack takes  's advice and tells Spike she can't think of anything else for him to do. Desperate, Spike rationalizes that maybe she needs help thinking of things she needs help with, like her back needs itching, to remember her favorite song, even  .   Applejack is at her wit's end. She seeks out Twilight, who's still muzzle-deep in a book. When Applejack manages to finally get Twilight's attention, she explains what she believes Twilight to already be aware of: that Spike is following his dragon code and serving her forever for saving him from timberwolves. This is news to Twilight, who was too distracted to be aware of   that was going on around her. But now that she's brought up to speed, she has the answer. Applejack keeps Spike occupied while she convenes with her friends (now including  ) in the barn. The plan: have Spike save Applejack's life from a timberwolf!   Just outside the Everfree Forest, Applejack and the others make ready to put their plan into action. Before Rarity could call into question her believability as a ""damsel in distress"", Spike approaches, prompting everypony to take their places. As Spike is put to the task of gathering leaves, the plan is put into motion. Rainbow Dash roars like a timberwolf, Rarity flees and screams past in terror (while Pinkie Pie screams for the fun of it), Twilight brings a timberwolf puppet to life with her magic, and Fluttershy (with buckets tied to her hooves) makes the ""timberwolf's"" clomp sounds. During this, Applejack pretends to get her hoof caught in a pile of rocks, unable to get away. This appears to have Spike fooled at first, but he soon catches on, citing the lack of timberwolf breath as a dead giveaway. But when he catches the whiff of an actual timberwolf's breath, and Twilight and Rainbow Dash panic, the fake threat is made genuine:   timberwolves have appeared! As Applejack and Spike run away from the attacking wolves, Applejack climbs to the top of a pile of rocks and pushes a large boulder onto them as they run past; they're smashed to pieces. Suddenly, the rock pile collapses underneath her, and she takes a tumble and actually gets her hoof stuck. Like before, the remains of the timberwolves come alive and assemble into a single, much larger Timberwolf King. Applejack tells Spike to run, but Spike resolves to stay and save her. He chucks one of the smaller rocks at the giant timberwolf, and it becomes lodged in the beast's windpipe. The timberwolf starts choking. Spike pries Applejack's trapped hoof loose, and the two run away as the giant timberwolf ""dies"" of suffocation.    Applejack's friends are surprised to hear that she'd actually gotten herself stuck, and she both thanks Spike for saving her and apologizes for attempting to trick him. Reconciling, the two agree if one ends up saving the other's life in the future, to say ""that's what friends do"" and leave it at that (on the condition that they try to avoid such situations). They seal the deal with a hoof/claw-bump. That evening, Twilight is back in her library studying in the dark. Spike walks up with a lit lantern, and she thanks him. Spike hugs her leg, saying he's ""really really   happy to help"", and Twilight laughs.      "

Twilight points out that the princess' being late could be due to the presence of an important visitor, and she and her friends speculate who it could be. Spike gasps at something off-screen: something with ""a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail"". Twilight quickly deduces that he's describing  , and she and Rarity brush off the notion. But as they turn around they are shocked by what Princess Celestia has with her.   Twilight unintentionally snaps at Celestia for bringing Discord to Ponyville; her friends each have their own reservations about this as well. The princess understands the risks and explains that she has a use for Discord's   if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil, and entrusts Twilight and her friends with that very task. Twilight is still unsure but supposes that, should things get out of hand, the   could be used to imprison Discord again. As a precaution, Princess Celestia has even charmed the Elements to be immune to Discord's trickery. Celestia then asks where Fluttershy is, believing her to know best how to begin reforming the spirit of chaos. At Sweet Apple Acres, Fluttershy is settling a dispute between Applejack and an angry beaver; the construction of a dam has caused a stream to get backed up and flood the surrounding orchard. The beaver, a ""Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth"", agrees to move the dam, but only once Applejack apologizes for calling him a ""nuisance"". Applejack then shouts that he's lucky that she didn't call him a varmint. The beaver responds with some very unkind words that Fluttershy feels best left untranslated, and then gives Applejack a glare.  After some pride-swallowing, Applejack agrees, but Fluttershy quickly reminds her to not retaliate when the beaver blows a raspberry as a parting shot.  Examining the dam, the beaver then pulls out a key twig and the entire dam breaks apart. Applejack thanks Fluttershy for her help before Rainbow Dash appears to retrieve the two ""slackers"".   At first, Fluttershy is hesitant to accept such a task as great as reforming Discord, but Celestia's trust in her gives Fluttershy some confidence. The princess takes her leave for   and leaves the rest to Twilight and her friends. They harness the power of the Elements of Harmony to set Discord free, and upon awakening, Discord wastes no time in transforming nearby woodland creatures with his magic, playing it off as stretching. He reveals that he was consciously aware during his imprisonment and laughs off the idea of being reformed, especially the ponies' faith in Fluttershy, considering he is impervious to her "" "". But Twilight makes clear the conditions of Discord's freedom: behave, or it's back to being frozen in stone. Discord relents to these conditions, but not before entrancing a group of beavers behind the ponies' backs, and resigns himself to crashing at   for the duration of his rehabilitation.  Fluttershy tidies up around her cottage to make it hospitable for her new house guest.   Bunny immediately expresses resentment toward Discord's presence. Despite the rabbit's grumbling and the disapproving glares of Fluttershy's friends, Discord has quickly made himself comfortable. None of the ponies (except Fluttershy) believe a word he says to defend himself and take their leave of the cottage. Twilight speaks with Fluttershy one last time before leaving: Fluttershy believes the key to reforming Discord is to become his friend. Twilight has her doubts, but otherwise trusts in Fluttershy's judgment and assures that she and the others will be ready with the Elements if they're needed outside. Rainbow Dash convinces the others that they'll need a backup plan if (and when) Fluttershy's plan of befriending Discord doesn't work, and Twilight has just the plan in mind. After briefly addressing Discord's act of eating paper, Fluttershy excuses herself from the house and tells him to make himself at home. Once she's left, Discord reveals to Angel that he's indeed deceiving Fluttershy and relishes in this fact, all while harassing and frightening the poor bunny. Meanwhile, at the library, Twilight looks through book after book in search of a reforming spell, but she finds that all the pages pertaining to such a spell have been torn out, which explains the paper Discord was eating earlier.  Fluttershy returns home to find that her cottage has been literally turned upside-down, set in a slow rotation above the ground, but having told Discord to make himself at home, she allows it as long as it makes him comfortable. Discord comments on Fluttershy's boundless kindness, regards the rest of her friends as ""nasty"" and tricks her into thinking her efforts at reforming him are beginning to work. Twilight and Spike arrive, and Fluttershy tells them that they're making progress. Naturally, Twilight and Spike are skeptical. When they inform her that all the reforming spells in the library were torn out, Fluttershy mentions Discord's earlier paper-eating (to Twilight's absolute horror) but says that there's no need for such a spell. To prove this, she tells Twilight to bring their friends to the cottage that evening for a dinner party.  Twilight and Spike arrive at the cottage with the rest of the ponies, still wearing the Elements of Harmony. Discord greets them at the door and welcomes them inside. In contrast to how it appeared earlier, the inside of the cottage is decorated lavishly, with a large dinner table, cushions, and a chandelier. Twilight instructs her friends to not let their guards down.   The dinner party goes about as well as one would expect a dinner party hosted by the spirit of chaos would: kitchen and tableware spring to life and spray everypony with hot gravy and soup. Rainbow Dash has reached her limit and outs Discord as the mischief maker he is and always will be. Fluttershy calls out her friends for not giving Discord a chance; when asked why she was going to such lengths, she says it's because that's what friends do. The idea of being Fluttershy's friend makes Discord pause; he's never had a true friend before. Then Angel suddenly bursts in and, through a bout of charades, informs the ponies that Sweet Apple Acres is being flooded. Rainbow Dash points to Discord as the cause, and she and her friends leave to see to it, leaving him and Fluttershy behind.    Sweet Apple Acres is completely flooded by the time Twilight and the others arrive;  ,  , and   are floating in large wooden tubs and salvaging whatever amount of apples they can, and the beavers that Discord entranced earlier have constructed large, multiple dams across   the streams crossing the farm. Fluttershy attempts to talk to the beavers but with no success. Rainbow Dash asks if she knows this is all Discord's work, but she retorts that of course she's known all along: do they take her to be a silly, gullible fool?  Her entire aim is to befriend him any way she can, so he in turn would come to trust and listen to her.  As is his way, Discord revels in the chaos that he's created. Deciding that now is the time to see if she was right, Fluttershy tells him to fix it, and Discord agrees to comply - on the condition that Fluttershy   use the   against him, as a ""sign of [their] friendship"". Much to her friends' shock, Fluttershy agrees. Instead of keeping to his word, Discord proceeds to freeze over Sweet Apple Acres into an ice- and snow-covered landscape, believing he's won. Fluttershy becomes visibly angry by this deception, but she abides by her promise not to use the Element of Kindness, accepting a set of ice skates Discord conjured up. Discord wallows in his apparent victory, taking advantage of Fluttershy's friendship, and his freedom before Fluttershy announces she is   Discord's friend, throwing the skates down and away onto the ice. Discord shrugs off her anger, taunting over her as she walks away.  He asks if she truly believed that she could ""boss him around"" as he puts it, do what she asked because she asked, or that he even   that he'll lose his first and only friend.   But then, Discord has an epiphany: as he looks over at the abandoned skates he gave her, he finally understands the consequences of his actions - and realizes that he actually   value her friendship. Feeling ashamed and with his eyes welling up with tears, Discord reverses all he has created in a burst of light and returns Sweet Apple Acres to normal.    Discord comes before the returned Princess Celestia and with a bow, officially announces to her that he's willing to use his powers for the forces of good, adding a glum ""most of the time"" under his breath. Celestia congratulates the ponies on a job well done, but she leaves the Elements of Harmony with Twilight just in case. Twilight comments on how the princess was right about Fluttershy all along: that she would be the one to find a way to reform Discord. Treating Discord as a friend made him realize how important friendship was to him, and once he had it, he didn't want to lose it. After some encouragement from his friend, Discord states (very quickly) ""Friendship is magic."" Fluttershy claims that Discord can be a real sweetheart underneath. However, the others give expressions of uncertainty.     "

He prepares to mix jewels into the cake batter, but ends up inadvertently eating them. Upon realizing that all the jewels are gone, he blames Owlowiscious. The owl shows Spike his reflection in a spoon, and Spike notices jewel dust on his lips. He shouts in despair before noticing one last jewel on the floor. He intends to mix it into the batter, but ends up eating it as well. Spike shouts in despair once more as Owlowiscious rolls his eyes.  As Spike despairs over his having no jewels (and thus no cake), there's a knock at the door; it's   and  . Fluttershy is here to ask Spike for a favor since she and her friends are expected in the   the following day to   the  . Spike knows all about this and reminds Fluttershy that he wasn't invited. Fluttershy feels guilty over this and prepares to leave, saying that all she had to offer Spike in consolation was a jewel - a rather   jewel, Spike points out. Spike agrees to do Fluttershy's favor (even if it means looking after Angel), and Fluttershy thanks him before leaving. As Spike eyes the jewel Fluttershy gave him, he thinks to himself: Fluttershy isn't the only one whose pet might need looking after.   After a bit of sweet-talking and (in  's case) silliness-dodging, Spike gets  ,  , Pinkie Pie, and   to agree to letting him look after their pets as well, with some jewels as compensation. When they stop by the next morning to drop their pets off at the library,   even lets Spike watch over Owlowiscious. Some warm goodbyes are exchanged between pet and owner, and the six friends leave to board the  .

Spike closes the library door, and the six pets proceed to make a mess of  .  When Spike regains consciousness after   accidentally knocks him out, he finds the library in complete chaos:   is chasing Angel around in circles,   is ruining Twilight's books,   is ripping up the curtains, and Tank inadvertently catapults Owlowiscious across the room. Spike attempts to enforce some order. He manages to get Winona, Tank, Owlowiscious, Opal, and Gummy in a row, but Angel has taken off outside the library. With Winona's help, Spike soon tracks the rebellious rabbit to the  ' clubhouse, where  ,  , and   fawn over him. Spike tries to get the Crusaders to look after Angel for him, but the Crusaders have plans to get their cutie marks in skydiving. Spike, the smooth talker he is, convinces them to try and get their cutie marks for bunny-sitting instead. He even gets them to take the rest of the pets off his hands too. But he ends up having to relinquish one of his jewels (the one Rarity gave him) so the Crusaders could buy food and toys for the pets.   When Spike passes by the clubhouse later that day with fresh baking ingredients, he finds the Cutie Mark Crusaders are having just as much trouble looking after the pets as he was. He's forced to assume responsibility for the pets again, but not before demanding the jewel he gave them. They say they don't have it anymore, as the gem was used to buy an industrial-sized pet dryer. The pets drag Spike all over  . He crosses paths with  , who believes she has the solution for Spike's misfortune. But the help she offers involves donating one of his jewels to a nearby  , explaining that there is ""no worse mojo than  "". Down another jewel and reaching his wit's end, Spike wraps the pets up in ribbon and rolls them across town, having to surrender yet   jewel to   to buy her silence. After freeing himself from Spike's clutches, Angel sneaks aboard the train. Spike attempts to retrieve the bunny, but the train conductor refuses to let all the pets on without a chaperone. Spike sees the Cutie Mark Crusaders on a nearby bridge; he snatches them up and has them act as the pets' chaperones, and the conductor lets them board (in exchange for   jewel). Spike finally catches Angel, but the train has pulled away from the station. Next stop: the Crystal Empire!   The Crusaders fail to contain their excitement about seeing the Empire. Once again, the hungry pets have gotten loose; they make a mess of  's donut cart, and Spike is forced to relinquish one of his last two jewels to pay for it.   The train pulls into the station, and the Crusaders want to have a look around. Spike forbids them from leaving the train car, but after a bit of tickle torture with one of Scootaloo's feathers and some backup from Angel, they get past him. Spike chases after Angel and spots Twilight and her friends about to board the Ponyville-bound train. As the Crusaders admire some crystal snow globes in a shop window, Spike sees Angel running toward Fluttershy and gives chase again. Using his last remaining jewel (Fluttershy's large emerald), Spike obstructs Angel's path with a pile of luggage and catches him. Spike, the Crusaders, and the pets board the train again, but so have Twilight and her friends, who are right in the adjacent train car. They hide under the seats as the ponies enter to sit down. Angel threatens to give Spike and the others away by kicking Applejack's seat from underneath. Spike admits defeat and tells Angel to do his worst, apologizing for ignoring him, trying to pawn him off on someone else, and not fluffing his tail as promised. He extends this apology to the rest of the pets and faults his own greed. The pets quickly forgive Spike, but his growling stomach almost gives them away. Angel dashes off the train, retrieves the emerald, and force-feeds half of it to Spike to satiate his hunger.    When the train pulls into Ponyville, Twilight and her friends get off from one end of the train, while Spike, the Crusaders, and the pets get off from the other end, pretending to have come to meet them. Twilight and Fluttershy commend Spike on doing a good job of taking care of their animal friends. Sweetie Belle casually mentions Crystal Empire's snow globes, making Rarity suspicious and nearly blowing their cover, but she states that it was a lucky guess.

When asked of what was stopping Twilight from casting the spell, Larson responded that the script ""didn't include Starswirl's[ ] unfinished spell"" and that ""it was heavily altered from his final script.""     The episode begins with   awakening to a bright and sunny   day,   that she's certain today is going to be perfect. During her song, she wakes up   (who goes right back to sleep) and passes by numerous ponies around town, including the Quills and Sofas store  , who previously appeared in  . As her song reaches its climax, Twilight is suddenly interrupted by a splash of rainwater. She immediately accuses   for the rain but instead finds   on a nearby bridge attempting to manipulate the rainclouds; and to Twilight's shock, Rarity has Rainbow Dash's  .  Twilight questions Rarity about why (or even  ) she's controlling the weather and what happened to her cutie mark. Rarity doesn't know what Twilight is talking about. She explains that she is simply doing what she's done since the day her cutie mark first appeared. Rarity's ""quilt"" of clouds causes it to rain and snow simultaneously in Ponyville, earning her the irritation of the town's residents.  Twilight and a very sleepy Spike go to  's   (which, according to Rarity, is actually Rainbow Dash's cottage) to find out what's going on. They find a sullen Rainbow Dash inside and open the cottage door to the sight of dozens of woodland animals running amok. What's more, Rainbow Dash has Fluttershy's cutie mark. Twilight finds Fluttershy at   with Pinkie Pie's cutie mark, trying to make ponies laugh.  , wearing Applejack's mark, is trying her best to manage  , and   (with Rarity's mark) is at Carousel Boutique trying to make dresses.

The last page in the book contains Star Swirl's secret, unfinished masterpiece, and Celestia had tasked Twilight with making sense of the spell, believing she is the only pony capable of doing so. She had started by reading the spell aloud:  As she did so, she inadvertently cast the spell on the nearby  , causing them all (aside from Twilight's) to change colors. Twilight deduces that this caused her friends' cutie marks to be swapped around as well. Spike suggests casting a counter spell, but there is none. He then suggests her memory-fixing spell from  . Twilight explains that it isn't her friends'   that have been altered but their  . And  's cure for the   wouldn't help either. Realizing their dead-end situation, Spike reasons that maybe their friends will grow to like their new lives, but Twilight truly doubts it, accepting blame for her friends' misery. Twilight goes up to her room and   over her terrible mistake and how much misery she's brought to both her friends and to Ponyville. Spike consoles her, saying he's sure she'll find a way to help her friends and fix everything. Reassured, Twilight looks at a photograph of her with her friends.  Suddenly, Twilight starts to glow, and she gets an idea: if she can't remind her friends of who they are, she'll remind them of what they mean to each other.

Back at the cottage, the situation is even worse than before: Rainbow Dash is tied up in a pot, with the animals dancing around her. Fluttershy asks Twilight for a spell, but Twilight refuses and tells her to handle the animals. Fluttershy steps in to feed the woodland creatures, and they instantly calm down and warm up to her. She begins to glow, realizing that this is what she's meant to do, that this is her destiny. Twilight then places the element of kindness on Fluttershy.

With her friends restored to their true selves, Twilight has another epiphany: She knows how to complete Star Swirl's spell! She and her friends return to the library, and Twilight rewrites the spell's incantation:  Having completed the spell, the Elements of Harmony spark to life, bathing Twilight in their light. She suddenly vanishes into thin air, leaving a scorch mark on the wood floor in the shape and pattern of her cutie mark.   Twilight appears in a strange, ethereal space full of stars and nebulae. Princess Celestia appears before her, congratulating her on creating a brand new form of magic, accomplishing something even Star Swirl the Bearded couldn't, since he didn't understand friendship the way Twilight does.

Suddenly, a shifting blob of magenta energy emerges from Twilight's chest and begins to swirl around her while a pulsing white light grows from her very center. Twilight is lifted into the air, the whirls of magenta and white blanket her, and she disappears in a brilliant flash, like the supernova of a star. In the night sky over Ponyville, a variation of Twilight's cutie mark (sporting six small white stars instead of five) appears and floats down to the ground. Twilight's friends watch as the light fades away and Twilight appears, now a little taller  and with a pair of feathered wings.   As the others gather around to marvel at Twilight's new look, Rarity states that Twilight has become an  , with Fluttershy commenting that she looks just like a princess. Princess Celestia appears and states that Twilight   a princess, explaining that since arriving in Ponyville, she's displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and leadership that a true princess is known for. Twilight worries that this means she won't be Celestia's student anymore. Princess Celestia says she'll still be there to help and guide her, but Twilight has just as much to   now as she has to  .

On the castle balcony, Twilight waves to a crowd of hundreds of cheering ponies. Princess Celestia prompts her to say a few words. In her first official address as princess, Twilight says friendship was at one time something she didn't care much about, but she wouldn't be standing there if it weren't for the friendships she's made. She expresses to her friends her undying gratitude, and considers herself the luckiest pony in Equestria. It's an emotional day for all, even  , who Twilight is surprised to find crying.

Rarity questions why she insists on that as she has already given up on wearing her crown all the time, and she should at least embrace her royal title. Twilight concedes that if other ponies want to address her that way it's fine, but it feels wrong for her own friends to do so. Rainbow has her run through her performance's big finish, and Twilight has no problem soaring, but her coordination falls apart after smashing through three clouds, loops out of control, and plows a furrow into the ground.  In the throne room, Twilight's friends admire the new stain glass window commemorating Twilight's ascension and coronation, along with  's spell book and a purple book with her cutie mark on the cover underneath. Twilight feels downcast that her friends won't be in Canterlot for the official Summer Sun Celebration, as it was the celebration that brought them all together. It doesn't feel right to any of them that they won't be spending their special day with Twilight in Canterlot, but   was desperate for Twilight's friends to help set up the local celebration for  .

However, even as the   pulls away, Twilight tells Spike that she still can't help feeling like she's already missing something.   That evening in their castle guest quarters, Spike goes over a checklist and noting that they are way ahead of schedule, suggests that they have time to make a quick trip to Ponyville, then return to finish off the checklist before the celebration. Twilight decides to stay in Canterlot in case something goes wrong that requires her attention; this being her first royal duty, she doesn't want to let down her old teacher.   enters the room and says that she is actually looking forward to the celebration for the first time. Looking out the window as   raises the moon from a tower balcony, she explains that to her subjects, the holiday celebrated her victory over Nightmare Moon, but to her, it was always a painful reminder that she had to banish her beloved sister to the moon. She then brightens up, stating that it now reminds her of Luna's transformation back and the happy reunion with her. Celestia is happy to have Twilight as part of the festivities, but knows it must have been hard to have her friends return home without her. While no longer teacher and student, Celestia reaffirms that she will always be there if Twilight needs her, just as she hopes that Twilight will be there for her. After sharing a nuzzle, Celestia leaves Twilight and Spike to go over the checklist one more time. As she walks down the corridor, a black root breaks through the floor and pursues her off-screen. All that is heard is Celestia's startled gasp and a short cry of alarm.  The next morning, both the sun and the moon are in the sky, splitting the sky into half day and half night. Two Unicorn   anxiously take Twilight and Spike behind the closed doors of the throne room and inform her that both Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are missing; they've mysterious vanished. As the only princess available, they can only take orders from her. Twilight pulls herself together and instructs the two to continue the search and to immediately let her know of anything they find. Another guard bursts in with news from Ponyville: the   is invading!   The scene cuts to  , where Fluttershy is comforting a crowd of frightened animals. Fluttershy sees black thorny vines creeping out of the nearby Everfree Forest, and is terrified herself. At  , Applejack,  ,  , and   are trying to remove ""weeds"" without success. Applejack says she has never seen this type of ""weed"" before. A few spiky dark clouds pass by overhead.

Rarity puts out the vines' magic and wonders if   and her friends are pulling a prank. Sweetie Belle bounces down the stairs on her head, affected by the strange magic as well. The magic takes control of a sheet, which chases the siblings.    Twilight hurries off in the direction of Canterlot's train station, but Spike reminds her of a faster way to Ponyville: her new Alicorn wings. A bit sheepishly, she puts Spike on her back and makes an unsteady but successful lift off. They reach Ponyville airspace as the vine invasion grows worse, barely avoiding several of the spiked clouds. She realizes she is flying too fast for her limited experience to land safely at Golden Oak Library, so she teleports herself inside, leaving Spike to smack into a window. Twilight's friends tell her about the Everfree Forest, just as a large root breaks through a window. Twilight explains that Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are missing, and gives her friends their Elements of Harmony necklaces. Applejack tells Twilight that the Elements of Harmony will always keep the friends together. Applejack asks who they may be firing on, and Twilight comes to the conclusion that there's a bit too much   going on to just be a coincidence.   The friends head for a clear spot outside, stand in a circle and use the Elements of Harmony to summon  , who is taking a shower and singing  . Discord is not upset in the least, but he does remind Twilight that Celestia had told her that she is to give him a heads up before a summoning. Twilight demands that he immediately release Celestia and Luna and halt the Everfree Forest's invasion. Discord denies causing the mayhem and claims to be  . Fluttershy convinces Rarity, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash that they shouldn't turn Discord back to stone because he may be telling the truth. Discord thanks ""Shutterfly"" while hugging Rainbow Dash, causing Fluttershy to correct him. Twilight asks Discord to help them find out who caused the princesses to disappear and the Everfree Forest to grow, but after showing disapproval of the way he was treated, he directs them to   instead.    Zecora emerges from the forest with as many possessions that she could bring with her and explains that the growth of the forest is too much to handle, even for her, and she was forced to evacuate her house. Applejack asks her why it is growing so violently, but Zecora does not know why. Nevertheless, she pulls out a purple potion from her belongings and claims that it can help. However, it may only be activated by   magic. She tells Twilight to turn the potion from purple to white, and after a sip, she may be able to see why the sky is day and night. Twilight turns the potion white with  . She takes a sip and her eyes turn white. She finds herself in a hall in front of two thrones.

She then exclaims that there will be only one princess in Equestria, and that princess will be her.   Luna breaks down the wall behind her and raises the moon in front of the sun, causing a solar eclipse.

The script for this episode was locked in August 2012. Initially the cragadile was going to be called a rockadile, but it was already trademarked.     After a short recap of  , the episode continues with  's menacing, echoing laughter, and she begins destroying the throne room with her magic. As   dives out of the way of falling debris,   enters to survey the damage. Twilight comes between Celestia and Nightmare Moon, addressing her as ""Luna"" and telling her to stop before she is banished to the moon again. Celestia, not even acknowledging Twilight's presence, tells Nightmare Moon to lower the moon, as is her duty. Nightmare Moon proclaims that her only duty now is to destroy her sister Celestia. Nightmare Moon attacks and chases Celestia into the sky, prompting Twilight to follow. After several moments of dodging Nightmare Moon's magic, Celestia is hit squarely in the chest. Screaming, she plummets to the throne room floor. As Nightmare Moon cackles above, Twilight cries over the fallen Celestia and wonders why Princess Luna would do such a thing, not realizing she is in the past. As Twilight sobs, Celestia recovers and gets back up (to Twilight's great relief). Still not acknowledging Twilight's presence, Celestia raises the   as they appeared in the past, up from underneath the floor. Twilight realizes that what she is witnessing is the night in which Princess Luna was first banished.   Princess Celestia levitates the Elements, and they form a ring around her. Flying back up, she hovers across from Nightmare Moon. With tears streaming from her eyes, Celestia blasts Nightmare Moon with the Elements of Harmony. Nightmare Moon fires back with her own magic, but the Elements and Celestia's magic combined prove far more powerful; she is engulfed in a rainbow of light and blasted to the moon, creating the Mare in the Moon's image on the moon's surface.   The magic of  's potion wears off, and the light from Twilight's eyes fades, bringing her back to present day  . She wonders why her friends are all staring at her, and they tell her that she was mumbling to herself and crying, which   found amusing.   asks if Twilight knows who's responsible for the  's invasion, but Twilight has no answer. Zecora believes the answer lies further in the past and suggests another sip of the potion. Twilight does just that, and   stands ready with a video camera and tripod.   Light fills Twilight's eyes again, and she has another flashback, this time to Discord's first reign of chaos. Discord sits in his self-made throne as Princesses Celestia and Luna approach. As Discord helps himself to what appear to be seeds and scatters them all around him, Celestia and Luna ready the Elements of Harmony. Discord sits curious as to what they're up to, and the princesses harness the magic of the Elements; Discord can only laugh all the way up to his imprisonment in stone. The flashback suddenly takes Twilight even further into the past, and she finds herself deep within the Everfree Forest before a tree made of crystal. Twilight sees Celestia and Luna approach the tree, referring to it as the  . Twilight sees Celestia's, Luna's, and her own   in the tree's trunk.   Luna is unsure about what they're about to do, but Celestia states that the Elements are the only means of defeating Discord and freeing Equestria. She goes on to say that the Tree of Harmony possesses a powerful magic even without the Elements, and as long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows in the forest. The flashback ends, and Twilight believes that the Everfree Forest is growing out of control because the Tree of Harmony is in danger. Resolving to save the tree, Twilight and her friends set forth into the forest.    As Twilight attempts to cross a bubbly creek, she accidentally disturbs a sleeping cragadile. The angry beast advances on Twilight, who's unable to fly away. Twilight's friends restrain the cragadile with black vines, and Twilight berates herself for her helplessness. With no clue as to what will come after them next,   proposes that Twilight returns to Ponyville while the rest of them search for the Tree of Harmony. Twilight objects to such a suggestion, but her friends explain that, with Celestia and Luna gone, Equestria can't afford losing another princess, as there's no guarantee that Celestia and Luna will return when the Tree of Harmony is saved. Her friends all in agreement, Twilight pitifully makes her way back to  , and Spike follows her.   Discord is seen enjoying the chaos that the Everfree Forest is causing and using   as a nail file, up until Twilight arrives to scold him. He asks about the Tree of Harmony, and Twilight tells of her friends' decision to have her stay behind. Discord is surprised that Twilight agreed to such a plan, accusing her of keeping herself out of harm's way while her friends rush headlong into danger. The draconequus' words get to Twilight, and she races back to help her friends in the forest.   Meanwhile, Twilight's friends have yet to find the Tree of Harmony, and Rainbow Dash thinks their search is a lost cause. As she starts to question whether the tree is real or not, they find a cave at the bottom of a ravine from which bright light and a tangle of black vines emanate.   Twilight and   find themselves lost in the forest. Spike climbs to the top of a tree and spots their friends in the distance. When he alerts Twilight, he sees her surrounded by gas-spewing plants. The others find the Tree of Harmony completely wrapped in thorny vines;   believes the tree is dying. They try to rid the tree of the vines, but the vines fight back. The friends try to come up with a solution, during which Applejack and Rainbow Dash get into an argument about sending Twilight away, when Spike arrives, alerting them to the danger Twilight's in.  Twilight's friends rescue her from the gaseous plants, and   remarks that they're simply lost without her. The friends meet in the middle for a group hug.   Returning to the Tree of Harmony, Twilight's attempts to get close to it are hindered by the black vines. She remembers Princess Celestia's words about the tree's magic and reaches the conclusion that saving the tree means giving it the Elements of Harmony. Her friends are naturally uncertain, as they won't be able to protect Equestria or turn Discord back to stone if he gets out of their control. Applejack says the Elements keep the six of them connected, but Twilight corrects her: the Elements brought them together, but their friendship will keep them connected.  With everyone in agreement, Twilight takes the jewels from her friends' necklaces and her crown and gives them to the Tree of Harmony. The resulting surge of magic disintegrates the black vines, and the tree shines bright. The last few vines disintegrate, freeing Princess Celestia and Princess Luna. Twilight runs up and hugs them. Celestia then commends Twilight's courage in giving up the Elements of Harmony. Suddenly, the magic of the Tree of Harmony causes a flower to sprout at its roots. The flower blooms to reveal a box with six locks, requiring six keys to open. Celestia states she doesn't know where the keys are, but it's a mystery Twilight won't be solving alone.    As Twilight and her friends emerge from the forest, Discord appears to congratulate them. When he asks about the Elements, they inform him that they're gone. Discord is quick to ponder the possibilities of this, but Fluttershy swiftly warns him to control himself if he wants to remain friends. Applejack wonders why this all happened to begin with, and Discord mentions out loud that the seeds he planted should've sprouted long ago. Twilight asks him what he means, and he gives her Zecora's potion. She drinks it and views the past one more time.  Prior to his original imprisonment, Discord had planted his ""plunderseeds"" to steal the Tree of Harmony's magic and capture the princesses, but it was only until now that the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing. Twilight berates Discord for withholding this information, but Discord explains it was to teach Twilight a valuable lesson about being a princess. At the Summer Sun Celebration, Princess Luna lowers the moon and Princess Celestia raises the sun. At her cue, Princess Twilight (wearing a new crown) takes flight and produces a   effect with her magic in the shape of her cutie mark. Afterward, everyone smiles for Princess Twilight, even her.      "

Fluttershy is nervous about being in the forest so late in the day, mentioning that it is star spider season. Rarity says that she enlisted Fluttershy's help to bring some of the tapestries back to   for restoration and possibly inspiration for a new fashion line. They enter the castle. A large unseen figure looms above the castle steps. As Rarity marvels at the foyer's decor, Fluttershy warns Angel of the castle's dangers. The three enter the next chamber just as Twilight and Spike enter from an opposite corridor with a lit candelabra. Twilight intends to stay well into the night researching. As they exit the foyer, Applejack and Rainbow Dash arrive. Applejack says she brought them there because of a legend   told her when she was a filly. When Nightmare Moon was banished to the moon, not all of her   went with her, and whenever night falls on the castle, that magic would take the form of a being called the  . Rainbow Dash is skeptical of the myth.    Rarity and Fluttershy find a worn tapestry of  . Fluttershy flies under the tapestry to take it off the wall, but activates a hidden mechanism that rotates the wall. On the other side of the wall, Applejack and Rainbow Dash see the tapestry moving and hear Fluttershy struggling under it. They run away, screaming in terror when a figure casts a shadow on them. The wall turns back around, and Fluttershy pops out from behind the tapestry with a sprained wing. Realizing that the tapestry is too heavy to take off the wall, they resolve to find a smaller one. Rarity mentions the rotating wall to Fluttershy and concludes that the castle must have an abundance of secret doors and traps. They suddenly fall through a pit when Angel steps on a pressure plate. Angel nervously hops away afterwards. Applejack and Rainbow Dash gallop madly through castle corridors, starting to believe that the Pony of Shadows might be real. They decide that whoever stays in the castle the longest wins. Neither notice an eye in a painting on the wall watching after them. Back in the library, Twilight and Spike have yet to find anything. Angel's sudden appearance startles Spike, who leans back in his chair. The chair's hidden mechanism opens a reading chamber behind a bookshelf. Inside the chamber, Twilight discovers Celestia and Luna's  .   Applejack and Rainbow Dash walk down a spiral staircase and find a hallway lined with torch wall-mounts shaped like pony legs.   Under the trap door they fell through, Rarity and Fluttershy end up in a small, dark hollow with nothing but a small hole in the wall. Rarity reaches her hoof through the hole, just as Rainbow Dash feels someone put her hoof around her. She thinks it's Applejack, but Applejack is standing several feet away. The wiggling hoof in the wall scares Applejack and Rainbow into fleeing, and Rarity panics over feeling something alive. Thinking it's Angel, Fluttershy reaches through the hole and pulls on one of the torch wall-mounts, causing the wall to spin around and free them. Rarity has reached her wit's end, and Fluttershy is still worried about Angel. As Angel helps himself to a bowl of carrots, Twilight reads about Celestia and Luna's favorite castle traps in their diary, including the ""Hall of Hooves"" and the ""Organ to the Outside"". In a chamber far beneath her and Spike, a cloaked figure plays a pipe organ as Applejack and Rainbow Dash race past. Spike hears the organ playing faintly, but Twilight is too engrossed in her reading. Fluttershy looks for Angel when Rarity finds a pair of sun and moon-themed tapestries in the throne room. Meanwhile, Applejack and Rainbow Dash wander into a hallway lined with suits of armor. The cloaked figure continues playing the Organ to the Outside. Each note sets off a trap somewhere in the castle. One note separates Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Another causes Rarity to disappear behind Princess Luna's throne, leaving Fluttershy alone. As the cloaked figure plays another note, another bowl of carrots appear in front of Angel. The ponies' frightened screams and the organ's ominous tones fill the castle as Twilight is still too distracted to hear the screams.    Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash meander into the foyer, erupting into screams and sobs when they bump into each other. Twilight finally hears their screams, and she and Spike go to investigate. She finds her friends in hysterics and calms them down. Twilight leads them to the organ room where the cloaked figure is playing the organ. Twilight cautiously approaches and pulls the figure's cloak off, revealing it to be Pinkie. When asked about her bell ringing duties, Pinkie says she rang the school bell for five minutes by standing inside the bell and banging her head against it, after which she was told that was ""good enough"". She went to the Everfree Forest to gather bluebells for a ""finish ringing the school bell"" party, but felt chilly and had to wrap herself in the tarp she had meant to carry the bluebells in. She then caught sight of Fluttershy and Rarity going into the castle and followed them, because she thought they were heading to an ""everypony come to the scary old castle and hide from each other while I play the organ"" party.

The episode opens with   in a tree, teaching a pair of chicks to fly.   suddenly swoops in, repeating ""four more months"" in excitement and asking Fluttershy if she is excited as well. Fluttershy admits to being ""a little, kinda, sort of excited"", but does not know what she should be excited about. Rainbow explains that the next   book is due for release in exactly four months time. She proceeds to imagine at length what the next book will be about and what adventures and dangers Daring Do will face, including the Fortress of Talacon and the series antagonist  . In her over-excitement, Rainbow Dash soars past Fluttershy and straight into the tree. As the pair of chicks flutters around the dizzy Rainbow's head, Fluttershy begins to think Rainbow will not last another four months.   Rainbow Dash bounces her way toward the  , excited that the release of the next Daring Do book is now three months and twenty-six days away. She enters the library to find  ,  ,  , Fluttershy, and   are celebrating ""National Random Holiday Party Day"". Rainbow Dash wonders why no one invited her; Applejack says that she had invited Rainbow personally, but she was too distracted reading a Daring Do book. When Rainbow mentions the upcoming book, Twilight reveals that its release was pushed back by another two months.   Rainbow Dash starts to panic, unable to wait for the book even longer than before. What's more, she gets slightly frustrated at Twilight for knowing more about the series and its publishing than she does. Twilight reminds Rainbow that she introduced her to the series in the first place, adding that the author of the Daring Do books, A.K. Yearling, is her favorite author and she knows just about everything about her. Rainbow Dash asks Twilight if she knows where A.K. Yearling lives. She concludes that A.K. Yearling delayed the book due to everyday distractions, and proposes helping the author. Twilight has reservations about violating the author's privacy but slowly comes around to the idea.    As she and her friends travel to a remote part of  , Twilight is still uneasy about intruding upon A.K. Yearling's privacy. Her unease is interrupted when they come across a cottage in the middle of a forest. The six friends find the residence to be a complete mess and begin to fear for A.K. Yearling's well-being (and Rainbow begins to fear for the status of the next Daring Do book). Suddenly, A.K. Yearling herself enters the house, wondering what Twilight and her friends have done to it. The six ponies deny having anything to do with the mess as Yearling starts searching for something. She locates a book with gold binding and a horseshoe on the cover, undoing a sort of lock on it to reveal a large golden ring. Yearling sighs in relief, saying only that ""it's safe"" before tucking the ring into her coat.   When Rainbow Dash asks about the new Daring Do book, A.K. Yearling ignores her and Twilight pulls her aside, saying that they should respect her privacy. Just then, Pinkie Pie calls attention to the three stallions sneaking into Yearling's house from a second-story window. The stallions confront Yearling inside, and she throws her coat, hat, and glasses at them. The author then dons a pith helmet and outstretches her wings.   As Daring Do fends off the stallions and keeps the gold ring away from them, Twilight and her friends watch in awe from outside. Rainbow Dash distracts Daring momentarily when she calls out her name, allowing the stallions to subdue her, and the gold ring falls at the hooves of another stallion— , another adversary of Daring's.   As Twilight and Rainbow flip out over both Daring Do and Dr. Caballeron being   ponies, Daring presumes that Dr. Caballeron is working with Ahuizotl, who Caballeron intends to sell the ring to. Caballeron and his henchponies take leave of the injured Daring, and the Mane 6 go to help her. Daring Do brushes them off and flies after Caballeron with her leg in a splint. What follows is a back-and-forth between Twilight and Rainbow Dash about the events of Daring Do's books and whether or not to help her in her current adventure; they conclude that the ring Dr. Caballeron has is the last in a set of rings needed to complete a dark ritual and must be retrieved for safekeeping. Twilight decides that the six of them need a well thought-out plan, but Rainbow Dash soars off before they can make such a plan.   Rainbow catches up with Daring Do and, after fighting off the sheer elation of meeting her hero, says that she wants to help. Daring Do makes it clear that she works alone; having to deal with secrets all the time, she considers it best not to trust anyone. Rainbow states that just because   can't be trusted doesn't mean   can be trusted. Despite Daring's attempts to get rid of her, Rainbow Dash is determined to help.   When night falls, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do find where Dr. Caballeron and his henchponies have set up camp. Daring Do makes a disguise for herself by squashing her helmet flat and covering her face with leaves to make a beard. With a large bag of bits, she approaches Caballeron and attempts to buy the ring from him. Caballeron prepares to sell, but Ahuizotl suddenly storms onto the scene and demands the ring. Caballeron makes off with the bits and leaves the ring behind.   Daring Do snatches the ring, revealing herself to Ahuizotl, and he sics his army of jungle cats on her. She fights the animals off while Rainbow Dash watches from the sidelines. Seeing Daring Do's hat on the ground, she picks it up and calls out to her. Her shouting gets Ahuizotl's attention, and he grabs her with his tail. Daring sees Rainbow Dash in danger and is once again distracted long enough for her to be subdued. Ahuizotl tosses Rainbow Dash aside, and he and his cats walk off with Daring Do in ropes. Rainbow once again offers to help, but Daring tells her not to bother, sarcastically saying she's helped plenty already. Twilight and the others catch up with a sullen Rainbow Dash, who informs them that Daring Do and the ring have been captured by Ahuizotl. Kicking herself for getting involved when she shouldn't have, Rainbow decides it's time to head home. The others are surprised to see their friend give up on another pony so easily, and Twilight notes that Rainbow put Daring Do on so high a pedestal that she can no longer see her own worth; they wouldn't be who they are if they didn't help.    Somewhere beneath the Fortress of Talacon, Daring Do is seen restrained to a stone wall and over a pool of piranhas. Before taking leave with the ring, Ahuizotl pulls on a rope lever, causing the chamber to fill with more water. As the piranhas below snap their teeth, Daring Do manages to free her hooves from the wall. Before her weighted restraints pull her down, Rainbow Dash swoops in to her rescue. Once again, Daring asserts that she works alone; Rainbow comments that it's lucky for Daring that   doesn't.   In the fortress' central chamber, Ahuizotl prepares to use the ring to complete the ritual when Twilight and her friends appear. They snatch the ring away and fend off the attempts of Ahuizotl's henchponies to retrieve it. As the henchponies chase Twilight and company up and down the chamber, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do sneak toward the altar. At Daring Do's direction, the two remove the rest of the rings from a stone pillar, the removal of which will cause the fortress to collapse. Daring reveals to Rainbow that she'd planned to get herself captured all along so she could get inside the fortress, but she had not accounted for the rings' weight and admits that having help can be handy at times. By the time Ahuizotl retrieves the ring from Twilight and her friends, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do have succeeded in causing the fortress's collapse. The ponies make their escape from the crumbling fortress, and amidst the rubble, Ahuizotl emerges and swears revenge on Daring Do.   After shattering the ring to pieces, Daring Do thanks Rainbow Dash for her help. She extends a hoofshake to Rainbow, but Rainbow suddenly hugs her instead. Once they part, Daring Do leaves to finish her book. Some time later, as Rainbow Dash writes her   in her friends' journal, a mailpony arrives with a package from A.K. Yearling: an advance copy of the new book,  . Rainbow opens the package and is overjoyed to see herself on the front cover alongside with Daring Do.      "

After reining in Rainbow Dash's over-enthusiasm, Ms. Harshwhinny elaborates: the foals in the class are to be split into teams. Each team will create a flag-carrying routine that will be judged. Rainbow Dash interrupts to inform the foals that she will be coaching them and that she herself was a flag carrier for the Equestria Games when she was a filly, with flying being a central part of her routine. Harshwhinny warns Rainbow to show professionalism as the students' coach and tells the class that Rainbow will be accompanying the competitors to the   in three days. After offering the students some more words of encouragement, Rainbow Dash takes her leave of the classroom (professionally, of course). Harshwhinny follows suit, but not before giving one more piece of advice: their performance should show the judges what their hometown of   means to them.    When the bell rings and school lets out, the fillies and colts all race off to practice their own routines for bearing the flag.  ,   and   are briefly stumped as to what they are supposed to do before they realize that they represent Ponyville's most distinctive feature: all of the three races of   live there in a harmonious mixed community characterized by friendship. The Crusaders know that conveying such a message through their routine will take hard work and practice, but they are determined; they may be little, but they have  . Seeing this,   and   have no shortage of insults for the Crusaders, ridiculing them for their lack of   as usual and noting that having ""blank flanks"" represent Ponyville would be unthinkable. But the Crusaders are still determined, and they are not going to lose confidence to being called ""blank flanks."" They accept Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon's challenge.    The Crusaders demonstrate to Rainbow Dash a brief performance, demonstrating the main characteristics of the three races and how they live together in harmony in the town. The act concludes with Scootaloo jumping her scooter through a hoop and the three fillies making an inverted pyramid as the town flag rolls past on Scootaloo's now-unmanned scooter. Despite her attempts to stay professional, Rainbow Dash is amazed by this ""work in progress"". She flies off, and the Crusaders continue practicing. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, watching from a hiding spot, begrudgingly admit that the Crusaders' chances of winning are good. They decide that their only hope of winning is to disrupt the Crusaders' own preparations, and Diamond Tiara decides that Scootaloo is the weak link they can exploit. The two bullies approach the Crusaders and offer insincere congratulations. Almost immediately, they begin to pour scorn on Scootaloo, implying strongly that she is unfit to represent the   at the Equestria Games due to her inability to fly. Although the other two Crusaders are dismissive of the bullies' taunts, Scootaloo is deeply disheartened. The flightless filly decides that the only way for them to win is for her to fly; her trouble with getting off the ground gives Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle cause for concern.    The Crusaders spend the next several hours, well into the evening, trying to rework their performance with Scootaloo flying through the hoop rather than driving her scooter through it. Because of Scootaloo's inability to do more than hover for short periods, this does not work, and Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle are quickly losing their patience (as well as sleep). When the Crusaders show the revised and unremarkable routine to Rainbow Dash the next day, she attempts to be supportive but it is clear that she preferred the act's original version. Scootaloo is worried about the competition the next day. She is about to voice her next idea to help her fly, but Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle are too tired to continue. They begin to resent the whole routine and accuse Scootaloo of making the performance all about herself. The two call it a day and leave for the day, leaving an increasingly despondent Scootaloo to practice alone. Despite hours of trying, Scootaloo fails to fly and finally gives up. The next morning, the foals of Cheerilee's class are boarding the   to the Crystal Empire, and Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle see that Scootaloo is nowhere to be seen. Scootaloo arrives at the last minute and informs her friends that she won't be going with them, saying that their chances of winning are hindered by her inability to fly. The tension between the three boils over and Apple Bloom loses her temper, telling Scootaloo that if she wants to quit, they don't need her. Scootaloo, deeply upset, is left on the platform as her friends board the train and leave for the flag ceremony auditions.    On the train, Rainbow Dash talks excitedly with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle about their upcoming audition. When she hears that Scootaloo stayed in Ponyville and that the other two did nothing to stop her from quitting, she expresses her disappointment in them for leaving their friend behind. Rainbow Dash pulls the emergency brake and urges the two Crusaders to follow her back to Ponyville and get Scootaloo. In her bedroom, a dejected Scootaloo pulls down various athletics-themed posters from the walls, throwing them in a garbage bin along with her scooter. Rainbow Dash enters with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle, who tell Scootaloo that they still need her for their routine: whether she can fly or not. Drawing focus once again to the fact that she can't fly, Scootaloo reminds Rainbow Dash that she flew when she was a flag carrier. Rainbow tells her it doesn't matter if she can't fly and reminds her and her friends that friendship, between the three of them and between the three races, is the point of their performance. Rainbow Dash adds that whether or not Scootaloo will someday fly, she's already ""all kinds of awesome"". Encouraged, the three fillies follow Rainbow Dash from Scootaloo's home, racing through Ponyville, Scootaloo towing the other two Crusaders on skis behind her. They ride through Ponyville, passing by other ponies and  , who acknowledges Scootaloo with a high-hoof.    The Crusaders perform their routine as intended before a packed stadium in the Crystal Empire. Ms. Harshwhinny then announces the winners of the competition and selected flag carriers of the Equestria Games: the Cutie Mark Crusaders, much to the chagrin of Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon. Rainbow Dash coolly congratulates the three, while Ms. Harshwhinny is left astonished by their performance, leaving Rainbow to remind her to conduct herself professionally. As the Crusaders share a laugh, Scootaloo looks at her bare flank. No cutie mark yet appears, but she expresses hope to her friends that they will get their cutie marks in flag carrying.      "
"Power Ponies","Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen","2013-12-21","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Ponies"," is the sixth   of the fourth season of   and the seventy-first episode overall.

She sees   reading a comic book and tells him to go to sleep, but Spike asks for two more minutes. He proceeds to talk at length about the  , their sidekick Hum Drum, and the evil  . Twilight sympathizes with Spike's investment in a book, but states they'll need to be well-rested to help fix up   and  's   in the morning. Spike relents and goes to bed, but when Twilight sees him fumbling in the dark for his comic, Twilight allows him two more minutes to read.   The next morning, Twilight and her friends take part in refurbishing Celestia and Luna's old castle. Spike wishes to pitch in, but the ponies politely decline. Twilight tells him to find someplace quiet to read his comic, and Spike shuffles off, feeling useless. Spike goes to Celestia and Luna's reading room to read, sympathizing with the bumbling Hum Drum. When he suddenly reaches the end of the comic, he finds a footnote in small, hard-to-read text. As Twilight and the others take a break from cleaning and come looking for Spike, he uses a magnifying glass to read the footnote:  This causes a magic spell in the comic book to come to life, and Spike is sucked inside its pages. Twilight and her friends, in their attempt to save him, get dragged inside as well, except   who just jumps in after them.    Spike, now in superhero attire, regains consciousness on the roof of a building in  . Behind him, he sees his pony friends in superhero attire as well and recognizes them as the heroes in his comic—the Power Ponies. Suddenly, there's an explosion at the museum across the street, and the Mane-iac emerges from the smoke, laughing maniacally and holding an orb surging with electricity. When   and   wonder what's going on, Spike explains that they were transported into his comic book and that the only way out to defeat the Mane-iac. The Mane-iac attacks the ponies with a pretzel cart and a mailbox; as Pinkie Pie dodges the mailbox, she demonstrates the super speed of her Power Pony persona Fili-Second.   Applejack tries to wrangle the Mane-iac with her lasso, but it works against her, and she pins herself to a lamppost. Twilight's attempts at using the Masked Matter-Horn's powers fizzle, Rainbow uses Zapp's powers to create a tornado instead of lightning,  's powers as Radiance prove less than helpful, and  's anger-based powers as Saddle Rager don't manifest because she's not angry. After watching in amusement, the Mane-iac takes her leave, but not before addressing Spike by his designated role as Hum Drum. After Spike explains that the lasso Mistress Mare-velous uses is psychically connected to her, Applejack reins in the tornado with Mistress Mare-velous' powers, and Spike once again explains to his friends that the only way out of the comic book world is to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device. While Rainbow Dash is excited about having superpowers, Spike is less than thrilled about being the powerless Hum Drum. Twilight encourages Spike by saying he's not really Hum Drum, but he is still in low spirits.    Spike leads the Power Ponies to the Mane-iac's headquarters: her shampoo factory. Before Twilight can come up with a plan, Rainbow Dash gives away her and her friends' position by zapping the building with lightning. As Spike stays back, the Mane-iac's henchponies emerge from the factory and attack. Despite Fluttershy's inability to get angry, the Power Ponies subdue and restrain the henchponies. When the Mane-iac herself appears, she immobilizes the Power Ponies with her ""hairspray ray of doom"". She leaves Hum Drum behind, considering it pointless to use her spray on him. Spike watches helplessly as the Mane-iac and her henchponies take the Power Ponies prisoner.    Spike sneaks into the factory through an air duct, all the while calling himself useless, and finds his friends still immobilized and inside a big cage. Each time the effect of the spray wears off, one of the henchponies sprays them again. The Mane-iac uses the Electro-Orb to power her hair dryer-shaped cannon, and tells the Power Ponies her plan to use it on them and the citizens of Maretropolis and cause their manes to grow wildly. When Fluttershy reminds her of Hum Drum, the Mane-iac once again dismisses the little guy as useless. The Power Ponies disagree, with Twilight noting that in their world, he always comes through.   Encouraged by his friends' words of praise, Spike springs into action. As the Mane-iac monologues to the ponies in true villain fashion, Spike ensnares some of the henchponies in a large tarp and immobilizes more with the Mane-iac's hairspray, allowing the Power Ponies to break free. The ponies fight off the rest of the henchponies as the Mane-iac powers up her cannon to shoot Fluttershy who isn't trying to use her powers. When a firefly gets in the Mane-iac's line of fire and she swats it away, Fluttershy loses her temper, and the powers of Saddle Rager finally manifest, turning her into a large, muscular monster. The Mane-iac fires her weapon at Saddle Rager, but its beam bounces back at her, and Saddle Rager smashes the weapon to pieces. The effects of the weapon entrap the Mane-iac in her own mane like a straitjacket. Spike declares the Power Ponies victorious, but doesn't finish his narration before the comic transports him and the ponies away.    Spike and the others are transported out of the comic book and back into Celestia and Luna's old reading room, returned to normal. As the ponies shake off the excitement of their latest adventure, Pinkie Pie offers the group cupcakes, which she picked up from the Maretropolis Bakery a half-second before their return home. Twilight commends Spike for his heroism, and Spike learns that he doesn't need superpowers to be a super friend. When Twilight asks where Spike got the comic book, he says he got it in a store in   that sold ""enchanted"" comic books, not realizing that the comics were magically enchanted as opposed to telling enchanting stories. The ponies and Spike leave the room, and the comic book suddenly vanishes in a flash of white light.   This is the show's second superhero-themed episode following   in  .

"Bats!","Merriwether Williams","2013-12-28","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Bats!"," is the seventh   of the   of   and the seventy-second episode overall. When vampire fruit bats take over   on Apple Bucking Day,   and   are at odds regarding how to deal with them, but disaster strikes when Fluttershy turns into a   after one of  's spells backfires. The title could be a pun on the common saying ""Rats!"" which is said when something wrong or unfortunate happens.   On April 1, 2013,   wrote as part of an   joke that the   would be titled ""Bats"" and that ""It's just like the musical 'Cats', but with, you know, bats. And ponies. But mostly bats."" The episode's premise was originally pitched to be a musical episode by   and its script was locked in October 2012.  The original opening   of the episode incorrectly credited Meghan McCarthy as the episode's writer instead of  .  This was corrected in reruns.     awaits the sunrise atop a hill at  . As a rooster crows, Applejack declares it officially Apple Bucking Day. She trots past a few of the apple trees, bucks one, and watches the apples fall, only to find them rotten and mushy. Applejack looks up and sees a colony of bats flying overhead.  Applejack summons her friends for a ""Sweet Apple Acres code red"" and tells them that   are swarming the orchards. She's determined to keep the fruit-sucking bats away from her prized blue ribbon apple—a much larger apple that she plans to enter into a competition in  .   proposes asking the bats nicely to stay away from the apple, but Applejack is skeptical.  When Fluttershy tries talking with the vampire fruit bats, they spit apple seeds at her. Fluttershy admits that she is unsure of the bats' answer because she has never communicated with vampire bats before. Applejack is unwilling to let the vampire bats claim any more apples, calling them ""nothing but a bunch of monsters"".   The rest of Applejack's friends, except Fluttershy, agree to round up the vampire fruit bats. When Fluttershy suggests letting the bats have part of the orchard, Applejack briefly snaps. Fluttershy elaborates that a sanctuary for the bats would give them their own apples to enjoy, and that the seeds they spit out would grow into more productive trees. Applejack is still very hesitant about the idea, as she recalls  's stories of the last vampire fruit bat infestation. Thinking for a moment,   formulates an idea to stop the bats from eating apples.  The friends regroup at the  , and Twilight says she found a spell that will stop the bats from eating apples, but it requires the use of Fluttershy's Stare. While Fluttershy is reluctant to use it, her friends convince her once she realizes what's at stake. Back at Sweet Apple Acres, the Mane Six round up the vampire fruit bats onto a single apple tree, where Fluttershy stares them into submission. When Twilight uses her spell on the bats, they refuse to eat apples afterward. With their mission accomplished, Applejack thanks her friends for their help. As they go to sweep up the rotten apple cores, Fluttershy looks over at an apple.   The next day, Applejack is back on the hill for ""take two"" on Apple Bucking Day. A rooster crows, and she sets off to buck apple trees. However, she finds that the apples are still rotten, sucked dry of their juice.  Applejack rounds up her friends again, with Twilight surprised that the spell didn't work. The friends track down the vampire fruit bats and find that they're still not eating apples—the spell seems to still be working. Twilight asks Fluttershy if any other creature could have done this, but Fluttershy doesn't have an answer. Twilight thus proposes a stakeout to catch the true culprit in the act. That evening, the seven friends walk through the orchards, with Fluttershy remarking of hunger and looking ravenously at the apples. When the ponies split up, they see a figure lurking in the shadows. Applejack signals the others to her location, and to their complete shock, they discover who's been eating the apples: Fluttershy, who's been turned into a vampire pony!   The ponies try to talk with the transformed Fluttershy—or "" "", as   calls her—but she only hisses at them in response. When they try to make sense of how this happened, Twilight theorizes that, when she cast her spell on the vampire fruit bats, it transferred their desire to be vampire fruit bats into Fluttershy through her Stare. When Flutterbat flies off, Twilight and her friends give chase, but she easily eludes them due to her heightened bat-like senses.   makes a comment about Fluttershy's Stare, and Twilight comes up with an idea. Applejack sacrifices her giant blue ribbon apple to lure Flutterbat into a trap. When she swoops down to eat the apple, Twilight and friends surround her with mirrors, causing her to use the Stare on herself and enter a trance. Twilight casts her spell again, and Fluttershy returns to normal.   In the end, Applejack decides to take Fluttershy's advice and sections off a part of the orchard for the vampire fruit bats. She apologizes to Fluttershy for not listening earlier, and   expresses her excitement for the upcoming cider season.  Later in Fluttershy's cottage, Applejack and Fluttershy close off their latest  , with  's help. Applejack gives Fluttershy an apple as a peace offering, but before she can respond, Pinkie Pie pounces on the apple, pretending to be a fruit-eating vampire-pony. As the friends share a laugh, the screen zooms in on Fluttershy's mouth and reveals a tiny fang.      "

Rarity is so pleased that her friends will be there with her that, as a token of her appreciation, she gives them tickets to see  , the most popular musical on Bridleway. When the seven friends reach the bustling metropolis, Rarity mentions to her friends that she was able to get tickets to a sold-out musical by doing something nice for the musical's costume designer.   Rarity is so excited about being in Manehattan that she can't help but  . During the song, she shows generosity to a hotel bellhop, a grumpy stallion in a fedora, and a cabbie pony. Later, Rarity's friends ask if there's anything else they can do. Rarity states that all that's left is for her to check in at the Fashion Week runway plaza by 2:00pm. A quick glance at a clock tower indicates that it's now 1:50pm. As rain starts to fall, a now panicked Rarity tries to hail a taxi. However, there's a long line of ponies all waiting for taxis as well, and none are generous enough to allow Rarity to cut in front. Just then, the cabbie that Rarity had shown generosity to earlier pulls up to give Rarity a lift to the plaza. Her friends soon follow once they realize Rarity had forgotten her dresses.   Rarity enters the plaza to check in for Fashion Week, but discovers she'd forgotten her dresses. As she despairs, the hotel bellhop from earlier wheels her dresses in. After giving another huge tip to the bellhop, Rarity joins her fellow designers onstage just as  , the host and judge of Fashion Week, enters to greet them. She briefly chews out Rarity for arriving only seconds before being late and tells her she'll be displaying her designs last. Prim dismisses her and the other designers, and Rarity is greeted by an old acquaintance,  , who's also competing in Fashion Week. She offers Rarity help by moving her dresses backstage and marvels at the dresses' fabric. Mentioning that her own dresses need a little touching-up, Suri asks Rarity for a swatch of the fabric, which Rarity is more than happy to give.   The next day, when Rarity checks in at the plaza for her run-through with Prim, she discovers that Suri has created an entire line of dresses with Rarity's fabric and passing it off as her own. When Rarity confronts her, Suri—after putting down her assistant  —callously remarks that ""it's everypony for herself in the big city."" Rarity gallops out of the plaza in tears.    and the other ponies return to their Manehattan hotel room after an afternoon of fun, still looking forward to the rest of the day ahead of them, including  . When Rarity enters the room in tears,   asks what's wrong, and Rarity dramatically bawls over how much her generosity backfired on her. Naturally, her friends are all more than willing to help her through her dilemma. Rarity looks at the fabric in the hotel room all around her and is struck by inspiration.  The ponies thus spend hours sewing and putting together Rarity's new fashion line, and looking quite unhappy doing it. Having already missed their salon appointment and restaurant reservations, the ponies remind Rarity of their plans to see  , causing Rarity to snap at them. The ponies feel guilty about ""abandoning"" their friend before quietly going back to sewing. When the dresses are finally finished the next morning, Rarity takes them and heads for the plaza without bothering to thank her friends for their help.  At the Fashion Week show, the crowd cheers for Suri Polomare, and Prim Hemline commends her for her unique fabric. As Suri walks offstage and taunts Rarity, Prim presents Rarity's new line, which grabs the crowd's attention in an instant. Rarity is excited that she might actually win, but she notices that her friends are not in the audience and is stricken with remorse over how poorly she'd treated them.   As Prim expresses her approval over Rarity's dresses, Rarity's eyes flicker with a rainbow-colored aura. She suddenly races out of the plaza and toward the hotel looking for her friends, but the bellhop informs her that they've already left. Thinking they've gone back to  , Rarity dejectedly walks through a rainy Manehattan,   about her sorrows. Rarity returns to the plaza to thank Prim Hemline for her time, but Suri Polomare enters, saying that Prim is furious. Twilight and the ponies then enter; they apologize to Rarity for missing her show because they overslept, and state that they were informed by Suri that Rarity lost. Rarity doesn't care that she lost and apologizes to her friends for how she treated them, and she arranges for the seven of them to see an exclusive showing of  .    As the musical comes to a close, Rarity tells her friends that she was able to arrange an exclusive performance for them by agreeing to make the dresses for the costume designer's next show. When her friends realize this means Rarity will be away from Ponyville for some time, they express sadness but are otherwise happy for her. At that moment, Suri Polomare's assistant Coco Pommel enters the theater. She presents Rarity with the Fashion Week trophy, revealing to her that she had indeed won. Coco explains that Suri lied to Rarity and her friends about her losing in the hope that she would win by default after Rarity's ""forfeit"". Coco herself had gone along with the ruse until she saw the generosity shown between Rarity and her friends, and thus quit her job as Suri's assistant. As a token of gratitude, Coco presents Rarity with a small gift. In return, Rarity gives Coco her position of making dresses for her costume designer friend's next show.    Rarity and her friends wave goodbye to Coco Pommel at the train station and return to Ponyville. Later, at  , Rarity writes down the   she learned in the friendship journal before opening Coco's parting gift: a spool of rainbow-colored thread.

Twilight explains she's doing some genealogical research, and   specifies to Pinkie that   is the study of one's family history. Interested, Pinkie picks up a scroll and looks through it, making a shocking discovery about who she's related to. Pinkie Pie knocks on  's door, greeting her with ""Hey,  !"" The two friends later bring this news to the attention of  ,  , and  , who are all equally as excited as Applejack about the development. However, when Applejack takes a closer look at the genealogy scroll, she notices a smudge where it says   of the   is a fourth cousin twice removed of the  ; whether Applejack and Pinkie Pie are related or not is still unclear. To find out for sure, Granny Smith suggests paying a visit to  , whose cabin is ""practically an Apple family history museum!""   Big McIntosh prepares a wagon for the trip, packing all manner of things on it. With Pinkie Pie away doing her own packing, Applejack gathers her folks around her and asks them to show Pinkie only the positive side of their family. As Pinkie returns with a saddlebag, Applejack briefly pesters Big McIntosh when she asks if all the things he packed are necessary and whether the wagon's strong enough to hold it all.  Upon setting out for the open road, Pinkie Pie and the Apples sing  . As soon as the song ends, the wagon collapses. Applejack nearly gets upset with Big Mac about the wagon, but restrains herself with Pinkie nearby. When Apple Bloom and Granny Smith discuss their options, Pinkie Pie suggests turning the family   trip into a family   trip. Without a proper raft (which Applejack mentions is the only thing Big Mac   pack), the Apples construct one from the wagon's remains and tree sap. Pinkie Pie also starts taking photographs for a scrapbook. With that, the ponies set off down the river.   When Applejack sees the river splitting off in three different directions, she asks for the map. Apple Bloom fetches it, but quickly loses it when it falls overboard and a fish snatches and makes off with it (and an eagle swoops down to grab said fish). Applejack and Big Mac become annoyed with Apple Bloom for losing the map, but they still force a smile for Pinkie Pie's sake. The wise Granny Smith decides to take the reins, steering the raft down what she believes to be the correct path. Unfortunately, the path leads the raft—and the ponies on it—through the ""scariest cave in Equestria...""  ...causing the Apple siblings to become annoyed with Granny's questionable directions. Applejack attempts to take over steering the raft, and she and Granny Smith get into a light argument. Apple Bloom and Big Mac get dragged into it, and their bickering causes them to lose the raft's steering wheel. As tensions rise among the Apples, Pinkie Pie remains blissfully upbeat and oblivious—just as the raft goes careening over a steep waterfall.    With the raft destroyed, Pinkie Pie and the weary Apples trek the rest of the way to Goldie Delicious' cabin on hoof. A note on the cabin's front door states that Goldie is away doing errands. While they wait for Goldie to return, Pinkie goes off to get more scrapbook paper. Applejack, Apple Bloom, Big Mac, and Granny Smith exchange apologies for their behavior during the trip and understand if Pinkie Pie doesn't want to consider herself part of the Apple family. Pinkie Pie returns and, having heard the Apples talking, states that their closeness as a family helped them make amends; knowing that, she wants to be an Apple more than ever.  At that moment, Goldie Delicious returns from her errands. After Applejack informs her of their situation, Goldie agrees to help solve the mystery. However, when she looks through the record of the Apple family tree, she finds a smudged page. Pinkie is disappointed that the mystery of her genealogy remains unsolved, but Applejack assures her that, after everything they've been through, she's an ""Apple to the core!"" Apple Bloom, Big Mac, and Granny Smith are in complete agreement, and Pinkie Pie meets them for a group hug/photo.    With a new wagon courtesy of Goldie Delicious, Pinkie Pie and the Apples return to Ponyville, singing a   of their earlier song.  Upon the ponies' return to Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack and Pinkie Pie are about to write about their latest   in the friendship journal, but Applejack gets into an argument with Apple Bloom, Big Mac, and Granny Smith over who should write it.

On the way to the tryouts in the town of  ,   and   apologize to Rainbow Dash for not being able to compete in the aerial relay as they are competing in the sprint events; the Games' rules forbid any pony from competing in more than one event.   speaks with Rainbow Dash about her less-than-impressive team, Rainbow remarking that she's confident she'll be able to pick up their slack. Their friends are all equally excited about the tryouts for varying reasons.  Rainbow Dash and her friends enter the tryout grounds, where numerous other Pegasi and several griffons are gathered, just in time to watch    ,  , and   arrive with their own cheering section. Rainbow Dash coaches her teammates about the qualifiers and attempts to instill some confidence in them, but their coordination pales in comparison to the   team of Wonderbolts. Realizing this, Rainbow Dash's own confidence begins to falter. To help raise the team's spirits, Rainbow Dash has Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps watch Soarin practice for the qualifiers in hopes that they ""learn something."" During his practice run, Soarin is distracted by a pair of cheerleaders and clips his wing on a hoop, sending himself into a tailspin. Rainbow Dash saves Soarin just before he hits the ground, and he's carted off with an injured wing.  Now one relay team member short and impressed by Rainbow Dash's flying, Spitfire and Fleetfoot offer the vacant spot on their team to Rainbow Dash since she's originally from Cloudsdale; Fleetfoot quickly adds that it'd only be until Soarin recovers. Rainbow Dash is unsure about practicing with two teams at once—especially behind one team's back—but after a bit more encouragement, she accepts.   Rainbow Dash splits her practice times between the   team and Cloudsdale team, finding that her aerial coordination with Spitfire and Fleetfoot is much better than with Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps. Twilight starts to grow suspicious when she sees Rainbow Dash fly off every now and then. When Twilight finds out about Rainbow's secret practice runs with the Wonderbolts and confronts her, Rainbow argues that the Ponyville team will still qualify with her on it and that ""it's more fun working out with the winners than the non-winners.""  At that moment, Spitfire and Fleetfoot approach Rainbow Dash. They tell her that Soarin won't recover in time for the tryouts and offer her a permanent spot on the Cloudsdale team. However, her joining the Cloudsdale team means she won't be able to fly with the Ponyville team. Rainbow Dash is excited about the opportunity, but Twilight informs her of all the ponies she'll let down if she accepts. An uncertain Rainbow Dash asks Twilight what she would do, but Twilight tells her it's a decision she has to make on her own.   Later, Rainbow Dash appears on the tryout grounds covered in bandages and bound to a wheelchair. She feigns injury and wails about being unable to fly with either team. Twilight is skeptical of the obvious ruse. Rainbow Dash is brought to a hospital bed, continuing to fake being hurt. When Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps check in on her, they tell her not to worry about the tryouts, having found a replacement flyer:  . They also promise that, if they qualify for the Equestria Games and win gold medals, they'll give them to her. Rainbow Dash's friends leave to let her rest, and before she joins them, Twilight tells Rainbow that ""choosing not to choose isn't really a decision"".  In the adjacent hospital bed, Soarin is envious of Rainbow Dash and her friends, noting that no one's visited him during his stay. When he tells Rainbow that his wing isn't hurt and that he's been benched due to Spitfire and Fleetfoot's concerns, Rainbow realizes both she and Soarin have been lied to. As sunlight enters the room and covers a dropped flag in colors, Rainbow Dash's eyes shimmer with a rainbow-colored aura.   Rainbow Dash also confronts Spitfire and Fleetfoot for lying to her about Soarin's wing just to replace him with her—which Soarin is also displeased about. The two Wonderbolts commend Rainbow for her loyalty, saying that they could learn a lot from her, and invite Soarin back onto their team. As the Cloudsdale team flies off, Rainbow and the Ponyville team join them. Just as the Cloudsdale team finishes qualifying for the Equestria Games, the Ponyville team begin their own qualifying run, with some encouragement from the Cloudsdale team and cheerleaders. Despite a bit of fumbling with the horseshoe baton pass, Rainbow Dash speeds for the finish, and Ponyville just barely succeeds in qualifying for the Games. As Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Bulk Biceps are awarded medals for qualifying, Spitfire also gives Rainbow Dash a Wonderbolt pin.    In the  , Rainbow Dash writes her latest   in the Mane Six's journal, reflecting that while she enjoys winning, her love and loyalty to her friends will always come first. Rainbow hangs her medal and Wonderbolt pin on the journal's lectern before joining her friends outside. As she leaves, the Wonderbolt pin briefly shines with a multicolored light the same way the spool of thread shone in  .      "

At the Star Swirl museum, Twilight (in her Star Swirl costume) and Cadance enjoy the exhibits before the sick Discord appears before them. He tells them that he's come down with "" "" and has already given it to Applejack and Rarity. Before he can infect them with it as well, Cadance projects a magic health bubble around herself and Twilight. Discord asks Twilight to take care of him, but Twilight isn't very eager to.

Twilight and Cadance pull Discord on a giant golden chariot, and Cadance admits to being a little out of practice when it comes to flying.

At the train station, Rarity and Twilight await Trenderhoof's arrival, with Rarity beside herself with nervousness. When Trenderhoof finally appears, Rarity is unable to bring herself to even say hello and hides under Twilight's tail. Twilight is forced to drag her friend over to introduce herself.

All of Ponyville prepares for the Breezies' arrival with a gathering in the town square.

However, his excited bouncing shakes one of the tree's leaves loose; the leaf flies into the Breezies' flight path, causing some of them to get separated from the rest of the swarm and swept away by the wind. Despite the direction of a male Breezie named  , the tiny creatures are unable to correct themselves. Fluttershy saves the windswept Breezies and carries them to safety. The rest of the Mane Six commend Fluttershy for her quick actions, while Spike apologizing profusely for his mistake. Rainbow Dash asks if she should make another breeze, but Fluttershy decides to look after the traumatized Breezies for a short while, especially given their sudden attachment to her. Seabreeze however, looks worried by this decision.    After an hour of caring for the Breezies at her  , Fluttershy is visited by Twilight and  , who ask if they're ready to go home. The Breezies cling to Fluttershy, however, and she decides to let them stay a little longer, much to the frustration of Seabreeze. As Twilight and Applejack leave, Seabreeze expresses his bitterness about their delay in getting home and has no shortages of criticisms toward his fellow Breezies. Despite Seabreeze's frustrations, Fluttershy continues to dote on the tiny creatures. When she feels they are well enough to resume their journey, she is about to lead them out of the cottage, until two of the Breezies start coughing and sneezing. They and the rest of the Breezies fake having colds, and Fluttershy allows them to stay even longer, making Seabreeze even more upset.   Rainbow Dash and her Pegasus team stop by the cottage to retrieve the Breezies, but Fluttershy asks for a little more time. Inside, she and the Breezies are having a party. Having reached his wit's end, Seabreeze breaks the party up and expresses his yearning for home. Fluttershy agrees and is about to guide the Breezies on their journey again, but the Breezies are insistent on staying. Fluttershy asks Seabreeze for a couple more hours but discovers that he's gone. She looks through the open peephole in her front door and sees Seabreeze flying away on his own.  Seabreeze attempts to make the trip home alone but finds himself unable to fly straight because of the heavy wind. After avoiding being crushed by falling acorns, he eventually crashes into a beehive, upsetting a swarm of bees. Before the bees attack Seabreeze, Fluttershy arrives and kindly asks the bees to leave him alone. When appealing to the bees fails, Fluttershy angrily demands that they leave. The bees finally receive the message and return to their hive.   Seabreeze thanks Fluttershy for saving him; he says that the dangers of Ponyville are why he wants to get home so eagerly. Fluttershy realizes that her kindness nearly cost the Breezies their chance to return home. When Seabreeze wails that no one ever listens to him, Fluttershy places fault on his tendency to shout and insult others. He argues that shouting was the only way to get the bees to listen, and his wings shimmer with a rainbow-colored aura. The same glow is reflected off of Fluttershy's eyes, and she races back to the cottage with Seabreeze in tow. Fluttershy tells the Breezies once more that it's time to go home. The little creatures protest, but Fluttershy remains firm.  Saddened, the Breezies finally leave Fluttershy's cottage, and Seabreeze silently bows in gratitude to Fluttershy, who breaks down in tears after the creatures have all gone.    Rainbow and her Pegasus team are unable to make a breeze moderate enough to carry the Breezies home, with Fluttershy stating it's because there are too few of them to face the wind together. With a spell she learned from a book in the  , Twilight transforms herself and her friends into Breezies to accompany the creatures home. As one of the Breezies tires during the journey, Seabreeze offers words of encouragement and apologizes for his earlier harshness. The group of Breezies and ponies-turned-Breezies enter a small opening on the side of a cliff and pass through a slowly closing portal, entering the Breezies' home grotto. The other Breezies happily reunite with the ones they left behind, and Seabreeze reunites with his own family. Before joining her friends at the portal, Fluttershy bids farewell to the Breezies, and Seabreeze gives her a flower to remember them by. The Mane Six fly through the portal just before it closes.   Once back home, Twilight uses her magic to turn herself and her friends back into ponies. As Rainbow Dash expresses interest in being turned into a griffon or dragon and gets rebuffed, Fluttershy looks at the flower in her mane that Seabreeze gave her; it briefly shines with a rainbow-colored glow.

"Somepony to Watch Over Me","Scott Sonneborn","2014-03-08","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Somepony_to_Watch_Over_Me"," is the seventeenth   of the fourth season of   and the eighty-second episode overall. The title is a reference to the   song "" "". In this episode,   tries to show   that she doesn't need to be constantly watched.     At  , an anxious   waits for  ,  , and   to finish talking in the next room.   and   assure her that they'll be there for her whatever decision her family makes. Applejack, Big Mac, and Granny Smith come out of the room to inform the Crusaders of their decision: that Apple Bloom is old enough to stay home alone and take care of the chores for the afternoon. Apple Bloom accepts her family's decision with dignity and walks away with her friends. As soon as they turn a corner and move out of sight, they break into cheers.   Applejack and Big McIntosh load up a pair of pie carts outside. Apple Bloom is excited about staying home alone, but Applejack reminds her that doing the chores by herself is a big responsibility—a responsibility that Apple Bloom is prepared to handle. After Applejack gives her little sister a long list of chores and ""helpful reminders"", she and Big Mac go to deliver pies to two hard-to-reach towns, and Granny Smith leaves to visit their great aunt Pine Apple.   Not long after Applejack and Big Mac leave Ponyville, Applejack starts worrying about Apple Bloom. Despite Big Mac's assurance, Applejack decides to go back and check in on her little sister. At home, Apple Bloom checks off the last item on Applejack's list and finally has time to herself. Before she can enjoy it, however, Applejack comes in, startling Apple Bloom and causing her to make a mess in the kitchen. Seeing how ""dangerous"" things are when she's not around, Applejack decides to stay and look after Apple Bloom. In an effort to show Applejack that she can take care of herself, Apple Bloom accidentally makes the mess bigger, and Applejack is more resolved than ever to stay by her sister's side.    Apple Bloom tries a number of ways to convince Applejack that she can take care of things on her own, including raking leaves and bucking and hauling apples. However, Applejack's imposed safety measures and mollycoddling only frustrates the little filly. A desperate Apple Bloom calls Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo over to figure out what to do. As they discuss options, Apple Bloom sees the pie cart outside and gets the idea to sneak out and deliver the pies to their hard-to-reach destination. As a means of getting past the overprotective Applejack, Scootaloo gets the idea of putting big pink bows on herself and Sweetie Belle and having them pose as a sleeping Apple Bloom.   Apple Bloom sneaks out the window and sets out with the pie cart. Meanwhile, Sweetie Belle poses as Apple Bloom in bed, and Scootaloo hides in the closet. The ruse is enough to convince Applejack, even as she checks in multiple times. Several hours later, Applejack checks in on ""Apple Bloom"" once again. Seeing that her sister is completely fine, Applejack realizes what a worrywart she's been and decides to give Apple Bloom her space. Unfortunately, Scootaloo's excitement over this gives her away. Applejack discovers her in the closet, Sweetie Belle under the blanket, and the real Apple Bloom missing. When she hears from the two fillies that Apple Bloom had gone to make the pie delivery, Applejack becomes even more worried.   Applejack questions Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo about Apple Bloom's departure and finds out that she left without flameproof boots, a lion tamer's chair, a snake-charming flute, or a hunk of ricotta. She resolves to catch up with Apple Bloom before anything happens, but the filly has a head start of at least several hours.   Meanwhile, far from Ponyville, Apple Bloom makes her way through a dark, murky swamp covered in fire geysers (one of the geysers burns Apple Bloom's map). In the middle of the swamp, she encounters a  . Hungry for pie ""with a side of filly filet"", the chimera chases Apple Bloom across the swamp. Apple Bloom briefly gives the three-headed beast the slip and hides the pie cart in some bushes. As the chimera catches up and corners the filly, Applejack arrives. The chimera turns to Applejack, and the cowpony subdues the beast by putting the snake head to sleep with a flute, making the tiger head drive her fangs into a tree, and appeasing the goat head with some ricotta. After carrying Apple Bloom to safety on the other side of the swamp, Applejack scolds her for going off on her own, but she also commends Apple Bloom for keeping the cart and pies safe. Impressed by her little sister's resourcefulness, Applejack and Apple Bloom make amends.   Applejack and Apple Bloom deliver the pies to their destination, to the complete delight of the Cajun ponies they're delivered to. Applejack apologizes to Apple Bloom for getting carried away while watching over her, adding that while she would face punishment from Granny Smith for sneaking out, Applejack would trust her completely to take care of herself again.

When   answers the door and shoves them inside, they find the pink pony's upper-story loft filled with mountains of rock candy. With the arrival of Pinkie's sister   approaching, Pinkie asks her friends to taste-test her rock candy recipes. After some time of taste-testing—and the ponies collapse from stomach and toothaches—Pinkie explains that the candies are part of a tradition between herself and Maud in which they make and trade rock candy necklaces. Pinkie wishes to let her friends in on this tradition, especially with Maud going away soon to get her ""rocktorate"" in rock science. Pinkie tells them how much she's looking forward to seeing her best friends and closest sister get along. When Rarity informs Pinkie that Maud will be arriving at the train station soon, she bolts out of the bakery to pick her sister from the train station.    Twilight and the others put together a lakeside picnic for Maud's arrival. When Pinkie and Maud arrive, Maud immediately puzzles the ponies with her odd, stoic mannerisms and taste in pets. While Pinkie is excited about her friends and sister becoming ""bestest friends"", Twilight and the others are decidedly less so. The seven ponies engage in a game called ""camouflage"", which Maud describes as being ""like hide-and-seek, but   more intense"". The ponies have little fun playing, but they grin and bear it for Pinkie's and Maud's sakes. Seeing that their pets are all tired and bored, Fluttershy decides to cut the game short to take them home. As Pinkie leaves with Maud, the other ponies express how different they expected Maud to be. Believing Maud's strange behavior to be the cause of shyness, Twilight and friends decide to spend some one-on-one time with her to get to know her better.   At  , Rarity attempts to bond with Maud over their supposedly shared love of fashion. However, Maud shows favor for a dirty dish towel over Rarity's other fabrics, using it as a scarf. In the forest, Fluttershy introduces Maud to some of her animal friends, but Maud is more interested in rocks. At the  , Twilight learns that Maud loves poetry and writes her own. At  , Applejack and Maud make apple cider together, but Maud's idea of peeling apples involves mashing them with a rock. She also shares Applejack's honesty but is far more blunt and straightforward with hers. Finally, Rainbow Dash and Maud play a game involving throwing boulders across a lake. Maud wins but says she's ""not really into winning"", to Rainbow's complete shock.   The five ponies assemble outside Sugarcube Corner, where Pinkie is about to set up for them to make rock candy necklaces. The ponies tell Pinkie that despite their efforts to get closer to Maud, they haven't been able to connect with her like she has, and they wouldn't feel right taking part in a tradition between best friends with someone they aren't best friends with. The news upsets Pinkie, deflating her mane a little, and she retreats inside Sugarcube Corner alone.   Back at the library, Twilight and the others feel awful for upsetting Pinkie. Fluttershy says they should've just pretended to be friends with Maud, but Twilight thinks Pinkie would've found out one way or another. Just then, Pinkie Pie enters, claiming to have come up with an idea to bring them all closer together.   Pinkie brings her friends and Maud to a large obstacle course she constructed, calling it ""Pinkie-Rainbow-Rari-Twi-Apple-Flutter-Maud Fun Time"". Pinkie hopes to bring the seven of them together as best friends by combining all of her friends' interests into one big activity that culminates in a great rock slide. The rest of the ponies appear unnerved by the dangerous-looking course. She demonstrates how the obstacle course is run, but when she reaches the rock climb, she gets her hoof stuck between two large rocks. Her efforts to get her hoof unstuck causes a giant boulder at the top to topple and fall toward her. Seeing Pinkie in danger, Maud races through the obstacle course at high-speed, flying toward the falling boulder before pummeling it to pieces with her bare hooves. The spectacle leaves the other five ponies speechless.   Maud frees Pinkie from being stuck and brings her to safety. Believing that Pinkie's efforts for her and Pinkie's friends to become close are in vain, Maud decides to spend the rest of the week on  's rock farm. She says goodbye to the other ponies before leaving, and Pinkie goes with her. Impressed by Maud's feat to save her sister, Twilight finally realizes what she and her friends have in common with Maud.    Pinkie accompanies Maud on her   ride to the rock farm; Maud is glad that they'll be able to spend some time together before she leaves on her research trip. Pinkie apologizes for putting pressure on everyone to bond. When Pinkie and Maud reach the farm, they find Twilight and the others waiting for them. They apologize to Pinkie for hurting her feelings and to Maud for causing her to cut her visit short. They tell Maud that what they all have in common is their love for Pinkie Pie. Maud accepts this; though she doesn't outwardly show it, this is the most excited she's ever been according to Pinkie. Likewise, Twilight and the others are accepting of Maud's stoic nature.   At the train station, the ponies give Maud rock candy necklaces for her trip, and Pinkie and Maud trade necklaces as per their tradition. Twilight sees Maud place Pinkie's necklace inside a box and discovers that Maud hasn't eaten a single necklace Pinkie gave her. Maud smiles and admits that she doesn't really like candy.     "

Luna sympathizes with Sweetie Belle for being overshadowed by an older sister. She takes the filly into a flashback of her fifth birthday party.

Despite her past as a well-known swimmer and high diver,   is too old and achy to even get near the water.   On the family's way back into  , Apple Bloom expresses interest in becoming a high diver herself, but Granny Smith protests, citing the sport's incredible dangers. During their conversation, the family is passed by a large crowd of ponies—most of them in bandages—making their way to a circus tent. The Apple family follows to see what's going on.   Inside the tent, on a stage, a mechanical organ produces cheery music as salesponies nonpareil   step out from behind a curtain, making Applejack and Big McIntosh immediately suspicious. Through their signature smooth talk and  , the brothers offer the aching ponies of Ponyville a cure for what ails them: a tonic that they guarantee will heal them of whatever ailments they suffer from. After a demonstration of the tonic's effect on a pony who walks with crutches, Granny Smith is convinced and purchases a bottle of the brothers' miracle elixir, much to Applejack and Big McIntosh's worry.   Back at the creek, Applejack and Apple Bloom talk while Big Mac fishes. Apple Bloom is amazed by Flim and Flam's tonic, but Applejack is far from convinced that the tonic works as advertised. Just then, the Apple siblings see Granny Smith drifting down the creek. Believing she's in trouble, the siblings try to save her, but Granny Smith simply swims around their attempts, having never been in any danger at all. In spite of Applejack's misgivings about Flim and Flam's tonic, its effects on Granny Smith are clear; she appears to be as fit as a filly. Apple Bloom wonders what's in the tonic, and Applejack suggests they find out.   Applejack and Apple Bloom return to Flim and Flam's tent and spot the pony from the brothers' first tonic demonstration. As soon as he sees them, he runs away, prompting Applejack and Apple Bloom to chase after him. They corner the pony, who introduces himself as  , and ask him about the tonic. Applejack notices the props and wigs around her and discovers that Silver Shill is part of Flim and Flam's act. Before she can squeeze a confession out of him, he blindsides the two sisters with steam and runs away.  Applejack locates Silver Shill and follows him into the tent, where she also finds Flim and Flam. She confronts the two about their scam, and while Flim and Flam partially admit that their tonic is nothing but apple juice and beet leaves, the fact remains that Granny Smith is happier for trying it. Applejack, not wanting to take that away from her, concedes that Granny Smith's happiness is all that matters and leaves with Apple Bloom. At the swimming hole, Granny Smith is able to take part in her grandchildren's fun thanks to the tonic. Apple Bloom suggests to Granny that they enter the upcoming Ponyville Swim Meet together, as Granny's history as an aquapony would assure them a win. Granny is unsure about getting back into competitive swimming, but Applejack encourages her to enter. With this encouragement, Granny Smith returns to Flim and Flam's tent and buys their entire stock of tonic. Applejack even unwittingly gives the tonic her stamp of approval, convincing the rest of Ponyville to give Flim and Flam their business.    At the Ponyville Swim Meet, Granny Smith and Apple Bloom prepare to compete while Flim and Flam use the publicity of the event to sell even more tonic. Together, the filly and elderly mare give a graceful performance that earns cheers from the crowd and a perfect score from the judges.

Before she receives more recognition for her dishonesty, Applejack decides to put a stop to Flim and Flam's fraud. Just then, she sees Granny Smith climbing the high dive, preparing to break the Equestria high-diving record. She manages to stop Granny from diving into a small container of water and seriously injuring herself. As Granny grumbles over Applejack's interference and guzzles another bottle of tonic, the sun's rays reflect off the bottle and create a rainbow. The same array of colors shimmer in Applejack's eyes, and she decides to come clean.   Applejack tells the ponies that Flim and Flam's tonic is fake and confesses to going along with the deceit. When Apple Bloom wonders about Granny Smith's physical feats, Applejack proposes it was simply mind over matter: it was confidence that gave Granny Smith strength, not the tonic. Flim and Flam attempt to win back the crowd's favor, but Silver Shill intervenes. Inspired by Applejack's honesty and bravery, he too confesses to being in on the act. Defeated once again, Flim and Flam make a subtle retreat. Silver Shill, grateful to Applejack for helping him see the truth, gives her the bit he earned while selling the tonic and promises to pay back  .   Later, as Big McIntosh tends to the fields at  , Applejack writes her   in the Mane 6's journal. Granny Smith plays with Apple Bloom in a smaller pool, and Applejack goes to join them.

Suddenly, Twilight comes up with the idea of tutoring Rainbow for the test and teleports herself and Rainbow inside the library.  Working off of a checklist, Twilight tries various methods to help Rainbow Dash prepare for her test, including reading and highlighting, history lectures, and flashcards. Unfortunately, Rainbow's approach to reading and highlighting involves highlighting everything in a book; she becomes easily bored and distracted during Twilight's lectures; and she spends all of Twilight's flashcards segment shooting spit wads at her.

She meets with the rest of her friends to tell them her plan: with each of their ways of helping Rainbow Dash having ended in failure, they decide to try ""Rainbow Dash's way.""   A short time later, Twilight returns to where she left Rainbow and asks her if she wants to go for a fly. Though she's deeply depressed, Rainbow agrees. During their flight, Twilight makes small talk with Rainbow, and Rainbow still belittles herself, declaring that her dreams of being a Wonderbolt are over.  When they reach Rainbow's house, Twilight asks Rainbow what she remembers about the flight. Rainbow, to her surprise and delight, finds that she's able to recall facts about the Wonderbolts' history with ease. When she asks how that is, Twilight explains that she took advantage of Rainbow's monitoring ability and enlisted the help of numerous ponies to teach her without her realizing. Rainbow Dash thanks her friends for all their help, but Twilight says Rainbow deserves all the credit herself for her ability to absorb information while flying.    In the  , Twilight writes that Rainbow Dash had successfully learned the history of the Wonderbolts and that she herself learned there's no perfect method of learning—""everypony is unique and individual"". Elsewhere, Rainbow Dash completes her entrance exam and gives it to the examiner. The examiner hands the test back to Rainbow Dash with a perfect score of 100%, to Rainbow's relief and utter elation.      "

As the official princess representative for the Exchange, Twilight finds a large welcoming party waiting for her. Each of the seven friends are at the Exchange with various prospects in mind:   seeks to trade a mint condition   comic book for another;   hopes to acquire a first-edition copy of  ;   wants to trade a bear call for a bird whistle;   and   seek out rare, vintage items and decide to pool together their trade stashes; and Twilight herself hopes to trade away some of her old books.   At a trading stand owned by a   of   merchandise, Rainbow Dash finds the first-edition book she seeks. However, all she has to trade for it is an old, rusty horseshoe, which the collector refuses to accept. The collector only agrees to trade the book for an   owned by a dealer of ancient beasts. Elsewhere, Applejack and Rarity each find a vintage item they want, but each item costs all of their goods. Applejack seeks a pie tin that Rarity visibly disapproves of, and Rarity seeks a brooch that Applejack notes looks no different than the one she's currently wearing. Tensions rise as the two ponies argue over each other's prospective trades.   Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy approach the ancient beast dealer, but he refuses Rainbow's rusty horseshoe as well. When the orthros breaks the dealer's lamp, he agrees to trade the orthros away for a new lamp. Thus, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy approach  , a trader of  -shaped lamps, who agrees to trade one of his lamps for an antique chicken statue. A trader of antique chickens agrees to trade one for a crystal chalice. Rainbow and Fluttershy find a trader of crystal chalices who, ironically enough, agrees to trade one for Rainbow's horseshoe. Unfortunately, as soon as the trade is made, the chalice shatters in Rainbow's hooves. Meanwhile,   stops Twilight from trading away all her books for a young filly's broken quill, enforcing the rule of the Traders Exchange that a trade is only fair if both ponies end up with something they want. Because she doesn't have any plans to trade her own possessions, Pinkie decides to help keep Twilight from making the same mistake and sets up a booth to promote the books as ""official princess merchandise"", which draws in a large crowd of ponies.    Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy glue the crystal chalice back together and bring it to the antique chicken trader, hoping he won't notice its condition. The trader accepts and smashes the chalice with a hammer to finish a broken glass mosaic. Realizing they don't know what kind of chicken the lamp trader wants, Rainbow Dash sends Fluttershy to check while she remains by the chicken stand to keep other buyers away. The Pegasi fly over Applejack and Rarity, who are arguing for the other to get what she wants to prove themselves the better friend. Upon returning to the lamp stand with the antique chicken in tow, Rainbow and Fluttershy discover that Stellar Eclipse has gone on break, frustrating Rainbow Dash. Back at Twilight's stand, Pinkie becomes something of an auctioneer and hypes up Twilight's books to the crowd of ponies. Twilight becomes uncomfortable with the attention, stating that no one should trade for her books simply because she's a princess. Pinkie acknowledges Twilight's feelings but proceeds to mention to the crowd that the books were given to Twilight by  , exciting the crowd even more.  Rainbow and Fluttershy find Stellar Eclipse again, who is in line for oat burgers and refuses to do any trading until he's eaten one. Remembering that the Exchange ends at sundown, Rainbow and Fluttershy assist in making oat burgers and moving the line along faster. Finally, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy make the exchange for the orthros and make their way to the Daring Do stand; the two pass Applejack and Rarity along the way, who continue to bicker. The Pegasi find their path blocked by a crowd of ponies and see the Daring Do collector beginning to pack away her untraded goods for the day. Fluttershy remembers her bear call and uses it to scare the entire crowd away. In their haste to reach the stand, Fluttershy drops her bear call, which is lost among the returning crowd.   When the Pegasi finally reach the stand, the Daring Do collector tells them she no longer wants the orthros as she is frightened of the vicious creature, to Rainbow's outrage. Fluttershy asks the collector to reconsider, demonstrating her expertise at taming the canine. The collector agrees to give Rainbow the book on the condition that Fluttershy stays in   with them to help train the orthros. Fluttershy reasons she would need to leave   for countless   but reluctantly agrees for Rainbow's sake. Rainbow eagerly makes the deal and claims the book as her own, only to realize moments later that she has just traded away her friend. Pinkie continues to promote Twilight's books, especially the ""princess"" aspect, and is about to make a sale until she mentions that the books made Twilight the princess she is. Realizing they have nothing to match such value, the ponies disperse. Twilight herself also realizes how much the books mean to her, as they—like Pinkie said—made her who she is. Suddenly, Rainbow Dash zooms onto the scene and pleads for Twilight to exert her princess authority and declare a trade unfair.  Twilight presides over a small trial to decide the fairness of the trade; because Rainbow Dash said the trade was fair, her hooves are tied. Rainbow Dash argues that the trade cannot be fair because, though she wanted the book more than anything, nothing is worth more to her than a friend. The Daring Do collector is moved by Rainbow's words and calls the trade off. Rainbow Dash returns the book to the collector, and Twilight declares both the trial and the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange closed. In the end, Spike turns out to be the only one of Twilight's friends to walk away from the Exchange with an uninterrupted trade.    On the   ride back to Ponyville, Rarity gives Applejack a different pie tin that she was able to trade for. In return, Applejack gives Rarity a jeweled barrette that she traded her half of their stash for. When Pinkie Pie asks about the orthros, Rainbow Dash says she traded it for a bird whistle for Fluttershy. As consolation for giving up the first-edition   book, Twilight gives Rainbow her old paperback copy of  .

She thanks   for his help and calls him her ""favorite dragon"", a compliment that causes Spike to blush. Rarity is pleased with her own work, but  , the puppeteer pony she made the theater for, is utterly dissatisfied, criticizing its lack of mobility and room for his puppets. As Claude walks off in a huff, Rarity runs off in tears.   Rarity returns to the Boutique and wails over her failure to impress. Spike suggests that she make something else for the fair, but Rarity doesn't think she'd have anything finished in time. She sobs hysterically and starts wolfing down a carton of ice cream.   Determined to help Rarity out of her creative funk, Spike goes to the   with   and searches through the library for a spell that can help. Through Owlowiscious' hooting, Spike understands that he believes they shouldn't use  . During his search, Spike uncovers a hidden chamber behind one of the bookshelves. Inside, he finds a spell book made of stone and with spikes on the front cover. Oblivious of the danger of taking the spell book from its hiding place and Owlowiscious' hooting warnings, Spike opens the book and finds the ""Inspiration Manifestation"" spell that ""instantly brings ideas to life"".   Spike returns to Rarity, who's now gone through several cartons of ice cream, and shows her what he found. Rarity brings herself out of her despair to try the spell:   As a result of casting the spell, Rarity's magic aura turns green. With the spell's magic, Rarity transforms the stone spell book and her couch using only her thoughts. She returns to Claude with a puppet theater more to his liking and earns his approval. After a successful Foal and Filly Fair, Spike decides to return the spell book to where he found it, but Rarity convinces him to let her hold on to it a little longer. Spike doesn't see any harm, but Owlowiscious is less than certain. When Spike goes to the Boutique the next day, he's overwhelmed by an avalanche of dresses when the front door opens. A slightly manic Rarity pulls him inside, and he finds the Boutique packed with dresses Rarity spent all night making. She decides to extend her newfound creativity to all of Ponyville and asks for Spike's support, which he readily gives.   Rarity begins her beautification of Ponyville by transforming   and  's ordinary apple cart into a lavish one studded with jewels. An impressed Spike suggests asking Applejack to give all of her carts the same treatment, but Rarity wants to keep the changes she makes around town a secret from other ponies.   Next, Rarity gives   a cumbersome dress while she's in the middle of busting clouds; she turns one of  's bird houses into a bird   that her bird friend Mr. Robin gets lost inside; and she gives a foal birthday party a ""touch of class"" by replacing the food with hors d'oeuvres,   with the waiter  , and       with a string trio consisting of  ,  , and  .

She asks him if he's seen anyone suspicious, but he keeps Rarity's secret and says no. Twilight goes with   to assist the trapped ponies   and  , while Owlowiscious glares disapprovingly at Spike. Although Spike realizes he must reveal Rarity's secret, he is afraid to do so as it could cost him her friendship.    Unable to bring himself to divulge Rarity's secret, Spike determines that the next best way to stop Rarity is to get the spell book away from her so she can't harness its magic. He follows Rarity's path of creative destruction and finds her on the outskirts of Ponyville. While Owlowiscious distracts Rarity, Spike snatches the spell book from her and sneaks away. Rarity catches Spike, so he hides the book in his mouth and swallows it down whole. Unfortunately, Rarity is still under the influence of Inspiration Manifestation. Spike is shocked by this development, and though Rarity is initially upset by the loss of her book, she doesn't need it anymore in order to use its magic. She crafts four chariots (or ""Rariots"" as she calls them) and plans to spread her creative genius to all of  .   Before the situation gets even more out of control, Spike tells Rarity the truth: that the changes she's been making around Ponyville are awful.

Rainbow Dash thus encourages everyone to give their best.  As the train arrives at the Empire,   loads everyone's gear onto a wheel cart.   starts to worry that they're not prepared for their flag-carrying routine, so Spike teaches her a trick he uses whenever he gets nervous about a task: counting to ten.  During his talk with the  , Spike is suddenly carried away by a pair of Crystal Pony  , who deliver him to   and   in front of the palace. Inside, the   pamper Spike and treat him like royalty. Twilight and Cadance explain that, because of Spike's role in   from  , he is recognized throughout the Empire as a hero and is known as ""Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious"". Because of this, Cadance asks Spike to light the torch during the Equestria Games' opening ceremony. Spike gladly agrees, adding that as a   he can do so with his fire breath.   In the Equestria Games stadium, a gigantic crowd of ponies cheers and   briefly addresses the athletic and flag-carrying teams. Twilight goes up to the exclusive box seats, where  ,  , and other significant members of Equestrian society are already seated, and takes her seat next to Celestia. Spike makes his way to the stadium with  , who explains to him the procedure for lighting the Games torch. When they reach the torch platform, Spike becomes overwhelmed by the sheer number of ponies watching him. The Cutie Mark Crusaders carry out their flag routine and the Ponyville team enters the stadium. With some persuasion by Ms. Harshwhinny, Spike climbs up to the torch and finds both his fire breath and his calming trick of counting to ten not working.  Due to the torch lightning's delay, ponies in the crowd become confused or worried. When Twilight sees the trouble Spike is in, she discreetly casts a spell that lights the torch for him, and the crowd cheers. Ms. Harshwhinny is unsure how Spike pulled it off, but nevertheless, the Equestria Games finally begin.   Outside the stadium, Rainbow Dash,  , and   congratulate the Crusaders for their flag routine. Twilight meets with her friends and admits to them that she lit the torch for Spike so he wouldn't be embarrassed. When Spike walks up, Twilight is about to tell him the truth, but he's convinced that he can light fires with his mind. He tries to demonstrate this ""skill"" for   and   but to no avail. Twilight takes Spike aside and tells him that she lit the torch for him. Thinking that he's let down all of Equestria, Spike walks away utterly heartbroken.  Twilight's friends return to the stadium in time for the aerial relay—Rainbow Dash and  's event. As they enter, Rarity is told by security guards to have her magic disabled before entering the stadium to prevent cheating. As the aerial relay takes place, Spike asks Ms. Harshwhinny if he can do anything else for the Games. Ms. Harshwhinny is dismissive of his request; when she makes a sarcastic remark about him putting on a rock concert, Spike gets an idea. In the aerial relay, the Wonderbolts take gold and the Ponyville team silver. At the medal-awarding ceremony, Shining Armor is about to signal the start of an anthem when Spike jumps in, eager to ""do the honor of singing"". Unfortunately, since the Wonderbolts won the event, the anthem to be sung is the   anthem, to which Spike doesn't know the words. With the spotlight and everyone's eyes focused on him, Spike sings an awkward and lyrically inaccurate rendition of the Cloudsdale anthem, much to the discomfort of everyone listening (except  , who gives his performance an excited ""Nailed it!"").    For the rest of the Games, Spike holes up in a Crystal Empire bedroom, where the Crusaders find him packing up for their departure the next day. Back at the stadium, Shining Armor announces the final event of the Games: ice archery. With Ponyville having thirty-seven medals to Cloudsdale's thirty-six and Cloudsdale having two archers taking part in the event, Twilight's friends are anxious over the outcome. When Twilight goes to drag Spike out of hiding, he disguises himself and continually puts himself down, reluctant to face the crowds again. During the ice archery event, one of the archers trips up and accidentally shoots an ice arrow into the sky. The arrow turns a cloud into a large mass of ice that starts to fall toward the stadium. A number of   fly up to slow it down but are unable to divert it away from the crowd, and the security guards don't have time to undo their magic-disabling spell.   Springing into action, Spike hops up on the backs of several Pegasi and shoots the ice from below with a tremendous blast of fire, melting it into water and steam. The crowd cheers, and all of Spike's friends commend him for his actions. Spike, however, feels no pride in himself and simply did ""what needed to be done"". Twilight understands, saying that only Spike can fix the disappointment he has in himself. To that end, Cadance asks Spike to light the fireworks for the Equestria Games' closing ceremony in her stead.  In the end, Ponyville wins the medal count for the Games by a single medal, and the closing ceremony is underway. Spike, having overcome his earlier doubts, lights the ceremonial fireworks, and they explode over the stadium.     "

After saying goodbye to the dignitaries, Twilight asks Princesses  ,  , and   if there's anything else she can do, but Cadance tells her their visit is already over. Twilight is disappointed that, compared to her fellow princesses of  , her own role as a princess is unclear and she wants to have a purpose. Celestia, Luna and Cadance let Twilight know through   that her time ""is coming soon"" and that she'll play her part as a princess.

Back in the Crystal Empire, Princess Celestia wakes up from her sleep in a startle, and Luna enters her bedroom. Celestia says she had a terrible dream. Luna, having witnessed her dream, tells her it was a vision. As Celestia gets out of bed, she forebodingly states ""the stronger   becomes, the more we are   in danger"".

Just before he leaves, he returns the friendship journal to Twilight and tells her that he bookmarked some of its more interesting passages. Twilight takes Discord's words to heart and begins searching the old castle library for a means of opening the chest.   Meanwhile, as Tirek continues absorbing unicorns' magic, Discord appears before him and binds him in chains. Tirek is disgusted to discover that Discord is acting on behalf of ponies, saying ""friendship is but a new form of imprisonment"".

The ponies are transformed and given rainbow-marked coats, manes and tails. They confront Tirek, who is unable to overpower their magic. A blast of light strips Tirek of his power, and he is banished to Tartarus once more.

As they walk through the castle corridors, Twilight finally understands her role as a princess: to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. In recognition of her role, Princess Celestia designates her the ""princess of friendship"". In the castle throne room sit seven thrones, one for Twilight and each of her friends (except for Discord, who Fluttershy tells has yet to deserve one).

Sheriff Silverstar finds a horseshoe imprint in the dirt and deduces this to be the work of an infamous outlaw named  .    Upon hearing that Trouble Shoes—wanted for ruining several other rodeos across  —has come to Appleloosa, the townsponies are whipped into a nervous frenzy. Silverstar considers cancelling the rodeo, but refusing to be intimidated, he doubles his security patrols and declares that the rodeo will go on as planned. With a dangerous outlaw on the loose, Applejack almost sends Apple Bloom,  , and   home to   and even contemplates going with them. However, Braeburn encourages Applejack to stay and compete in the rodeo, and he promises to keep a watchful eye over the Crusaders. Hours later, after Braeburn has fallen asleep, the fillies sneak out into the woods to find Trouble Shoes. Apple Bloom and Scootaloo reason that, with Trouble Shoes behind bars, they'll be able to compete in the rodeo and get their cutie marks. Despite her uncertainty about the idea, Sweetie Belle goes along with them. Unfortunately, the fillies quickly become lost, and it starts to rain.    Braeburn informs Applejack about the Crusaders' disappearance, and the two go to alert Sheriff Silverstar, worried that Trouble Shoes abducted them. Silverstar, his deputies, Applejack, and Braeburn set off into the rain to find the missing fillies. Meanwhile, Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo—still lost in the woods—find a seemingly abandoned mobile cabin and use it to take shelter from the pouring rain. Suddenly, they're visited upon by a large shadowy figure. They scream in fear, startling the figure into clumsily knocking into things and falling over. The Crusaders' would-be assailant turns out to be a tall yet unassuming Earth pony stallion.   The Crusaders soon realize that Trouble Shoes means no harm and that he's only a victim of bad luck, indicated by his cutie mark of an upside-down horseshoe. He tells the fillies to leave before his bad luck spreads to them, but when they admit they don't know the way back to Appleloosa, Trouble Shoes offers to lead them there.   The Crusaders wonder why Trouble Shoes, having a reputation as an outlaw, is being so nice to them, and Trouble Shoes tells them the story of how he got his cutie mark.   When he was a colt, Trouble Shoes wanted to be a rodeo star but kept publicly embarrassing himself in his attempts. During his audition for rodeo school, he got his cutie mark and humiliated himself in front of the judges. Though he abandoned his dreams, Trouble Shoes still liked to watch the rodeo, but his bad luck caused mishaps every time. Since then, he's considered bad luck to be his ""lot in life."" The Crusaders realize that Trouble Shoes has been looking at his cutie mark all wrong and that he could still make a name for himself as a rodeo clown. However, before they could share this revelation with him, Sheriff Silverstar appears with the others to place him under arrest.   The next day, the Crusaders plead Trouble Shoes' innocence to Applejack, but she refuses to listen because of his supposed abduction of the fillies the night before. She leaves to compete in the rodeo's hay bale stacking event. At the sheriff's office, the Crusaders lure Silverstar away and free Trouble Shoes from his jail cell, saying that they're going to help him live his dream.   On the rodeo grounds, after Applejack wins the hay bale stack, the rodeo clowns take the field. The Crusaders encourage Trouble Shoes—wearing clown clothes and makeup—to join them. Trouble Shoes is certain his cutie mark represents bad luck, and the Crusaders assure him that it doesn't have to. With their encouragement, Trouble Shoes joins the other clowns. Despite his usual clumsiness, his antics are met with laughs and positive reception. During his performance, Trouble Shoes accidentally reveals his identity to the crowd, and the ponies of Appleloosa quickly turn on him. The Cutie Mark Crusaders stand up for him, asserting that his past mistakes were just accidents, and some of the ponies admit that he is a talented clown. Trouble Shoes apologizes for all the trouble he's caused and agrees to take responsibility for it.    The Crusaders admit that Trouble Shoes wasn't responsible for abducting them the previous night. As punishment for wandering off on their own again, Applejack has them clean up the rodeo grounds. Though they are returning to Ponyville as blank flanks, the Crusaders do feel pride for helping Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means.      "

Grampa Gruff explains—for a few  —that Griffonstone was once a grand city of proud and united griffons thanks to the Idol of Boreas. But sometime during the reign of its most recent king, a monster named Arimaspi attacked and stole the idol. The idol was eventually lost when Arimaspi fell into the Abysmal Abyss, and Griffonstone fell into a state of misery. Rainbow Dash believes that she and Pinkie were sent to Griffonstone to find the Idol of Boreas and restore the kingdom's pride and glory. Despite Gilda's indifference about the idol, Pinkie goes to the Griffonstone library while Rainbow plans an expedition into the Abysmal Abyss.    As Rainbow Dash is forced to deal with money-hungry griffons, Pinkie Pie finds the library to be just as much a shambles as the rest of the city. She chats with a very embittered Gilda and discovers, to her dismay, that the kingdom doesn't have singing, a party store, or a bakery. All it has is griffon scones, which Gilda sells to make a living, but they taste terrible, so Pinkie offers her services. When the distracting smell of their baking causes a griffon named   to fall out of the sky, Gilda helps her up. Pinkie Pie notices this and sees a good side in Gilda, but Gilda insists that no one is friends in Griffonstone. As she laments having had a friend once, Pinkie remembers Rainbow Dash and goes looking for her.

Pinkie grabs Rainbow, and Gilda grabs another ledge as they dangle from the rope. On a ledge next to hers, Gilda finds the long lost Idol of Boreas. She reaches out to grab it, but Pinkie is slowly losing her grip on Rainbow. Just before the ponies go plummeting, Gilda pulls them up to safety, sacrificing the idol to the Abysmal Abyss.  Gilda apologizes to Rainbow and Pinkie for the way she'd treated them. While Rainbow accepts the apology, she laments that Griffonstone will never be restored without the Idol of Boreas. However, Pinkie believes they were sent to Griffonstone not to recover the idol but to replace it with something better: friendship. With friendship, the kingdom could be made grander than before.   Pinkie and Rainbow encourage Gilda to befriend Greta by offering some freshly-baked griffon scones, which appears to go well.

Back at the performance grounds, the Wonderbolts have yet to locate Spitfire. When Rarity and Rainbow Dash return, Rarity accuses Wind Rider of framing Rainbow for Spitfire's disappearance. Rarity's accusation appalls Rainbow, but Rarity explains her case:  In the face of this overwhelming evidence, Wind Rider confesses to sending Spitfire the fake note, saying he did it to preserve his long-distance speed record. He states that sometimes playing dirty is necessary to win, but Soarin and the rest of the Wonderbolts disagree and scorn him. Upon learning where Wind Rider sent Spitfire, Rainbow quickly flies off to retrieve her in time for the performance. Upon their arrival, Spitfire dishonorably discharges Wind Rider from the Wonderbolts for his crimes, and Rainbow Dash takes his place in the show.

Applejack is especially excited to share her family's traditions with Pinkie's, including a traditional evening dinner, raising the Equestrian flag, hanging Hearth's Warming dolls over the fireplace, and opening presents the next morning. Pinkie Pie says that her family shares these traditions as well.   At the rock farm train station, Applejack worries that her and Pinkie's families might not get along, but Pinkie assures her that they will because they are such close friends themselves.

When Discord tells his inside jokes again, the ponies don't find them funny anymore, and now Twilight has her own inside joke with her friends that Discord isn't a part of.

She refers to this tradition as the ""Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day"" (or ""PSSSD"" for short). Because she always gets an amazing gift from Maud each year, Pinkie wishes to surprise her with a specially-made rock pouch for her pet  . She asks for Rarity's assistance in this endeavor, and Rarity eagerly agrees to help while also scouting locations for her new store.    Pinkie, Rarity, and Maud spend the afternoon touring the city of Manehattan, from the Mare Statue to the ice rink to a prestigious restaurant. Throughout the afternoon, Pinkie is less than subtle about her excitement for her and Maud's upcoming gift exchange, and Maud is mainly interested in sights associated with rocks.

Despite having no cannon to use the confetti with, Pinkie loves her gift regardless.   As Pinkie enjoys her Swap Day gift, Maud asks Rarity why she isn't using her party cannon with it. Rarity tries to keep Pinkie's sacrifice a secret, but after enough piercing stares from Maud, she breaks down and confesses. Pinkie also confesses that she simply wanted to get her sister a gift as wonderful as the gifts she always receives. With this knowledge, Maud goes to get Pinkie's party cannon back.

The three fillies realize that crusading for their marks is all they have ever done, and they wonder what to do next.

Scootaloo corrects her by stating they can still hang out, but they don't have to do   together. Apple Bloom admits that she did like dancing, but she wasn't very good at it. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo tell her she doesn't need to be good in order to have fun. When Apple Bloom mentions Tender Taps and his performance troubles, Sweetie Belle asks if he had his cutie mark.   At the Ponyville dance theater, the Crusaders find Tender Taps backstage, and Apple Bloom tries to convince him to perform. When Tender Taps expresses fear from performing in front of an audience, Apple Bloom says she'll perform with him so he'll look good by comparison.

He tells Apple Bloom that he hopes she continues dancing, and Apple Bloom says she will.

When one of the competitors falls into the water and sinks, Spike saves them from drowning and carries them to the island. This competitor is revealed to be Princess Ember in disguise, determined to show her father that there is more to being a leader than strength and size. When Ember discovers Twilight and Rarity hanging around Spike and that they are his friends, she is disdainful, saying ""dragons don't   friends."" When Garble approaches and picks up the ponies' scent, Ember keeps him from discovering them. In return, Spike keeps Garble from discovering Ember's true identity. He also proposes that they work together to navigate the Gauntlet's obstacles. Rarity is uncertain about teaming up with Ember, but Spike believes she can be trusted.   Hesitantly, Ember agrees to team up with Spike, and together they navigate the obstacles to the next leg of the Gauntlet. Realizing that she only made it this far with Spike's help, Ember decides to work together with him a little longer. Through their teamwork, they make it through a tunnel of stalagmite and crystal traps. As Twilight and Rarity congratulate them on making it through, Spike saves Rarity from falling into a lava pool. Ember asks why Spike would risk everything to save her, and Spike says ""that's what friends do"". Because of their differences in philosophies, Ember decides to end her partnership with Spike and navigate the rest of the Gauntlet of Fire by herself.  As Spike, Twilight, and Rarity continue through the maze-like volcanic tunnels, Spike is dejected by Ember's sudden abandonment. Though Rarity believes it to be for the best, Spike is still convinced that there is good in Ember.   After walking for some time, Spike and his friends make it to the center of the volcano, where the bloodstone scepter waits to be claimed. Unfortunately, Garble is right behind him. Before he drops Spike into a rock pit, Ember swoops in to Spike's rescue, admitting to herself that the two of them are indeed friends. While Ember holds off Garble, Spike goes to retrieve the scepter. Spike claims the bloodstone scepter just as the rest of the dragons arrive, bringing the Gauntlet of Fire to a close. For his first act as the new Dragon Lord, Spike commands Garble to go home and hug every dragon he passes along the way. He soon passes the scepter on to Ember, however, saying she will make a great leader and protect the ponies of Equestria as well as he would have.    Torch is outraged to discover that his daughter participated in the Gauntlet of Fire against his wishes, but Ember rebuts by saying it takes more than being big and strong to be Dragon Lord. Torch thus apologizes for underestimating his daughter's abilities, and Ember is officially recognized as the new Dragon Lord. As Spike, Twilight, and Rarity make their way back home, Twilight commends Spike for not only protecting Equestria but also gaining it a new ally. Thanks to this adventure, Twilight has permission to write letters to Ember with questions about dragon culture, and Rarity is inspired to make a new line of camouflage-themed clothing.      "

Some sweep lines were cut for time. Jim Miller was asked ""Are we gonna see more of THAT one Pinkie Pie from today's episode?"" and replied ""No plans. It was a gag.""     The episode begins with   and her friends racing to   to stop   from reading her morning newspaper. Expecting a review to be printed about the disastrous grand opening of Rarity's new boutique in  , the ponies feel guilty for causing the chain of events leading up to it. Fortunately, when they arrive at Rarity's home, she has not yet read the review. The ponies try to stop Rarity from reading the review and explain what happened during the grand opening, but she insists on ""no spoilers"".    As Rarity starts reading the article, the episode flashes back to a diner in which Manehattan columnist   interviews Rarity and her friends one-on-one about the opening of Rarity For You. Rarity begins her interview with high hopes, but her friends express how much of an ordeal it was. The episode flashes back further to Rarity and her friends walking through Manehattan's ""Saddle Row"", a street lined with numerous famous boutiques and where Rarity For You is located. With the inside of the boutique a dusty shambles, Twilight wonders if it will be ready for the grand opening that evening, but Rarity remains ever hopeful.   However, a number of additional problems arise. Rarity's pushy landlord   arrives and strong-arms her into giving his daughter  —who lacks business experience—a job in the boutique. In addition,   has taken up residence in one of the boutique's back rooms, and the upper floor is home to  's noisy dance club. Plaid Stripes starts making changes to the store that Rarity disagrees with, Rarity's merchandise delivery arrives in a disorganized mess, and  —whom Rarity has hired to work as a salespony—is unable to help with the grand opening due to a cold.  With everything rapidly falling apart, Twilight suggests postponing the opening of Rarity For You, but Rarity disagrees because of Manehattan's high standards. Her friends realize the tall task ahead of her and offer to help while keeping true to Rarity's vision.   While Rarity focuses on setting up the window display,   goes upstairs and replaces DJ Pon-3's loud music with quieter music,   interviews several potential boutique employees,   politely rejects Plaid Stripes' business ideas, Twilight organizes Rarity's disorganized dresses, and   tries to evict the family of raccoons from the building. Unfortunately, this leads to even further misfortune as Rainbow doesn't know who to hire, Applejack draws the fury of Plaid Stripes' father, DJ Pon-3 continues to blast loud music upstairs, and the raccoons angrily turn on Fluttershy. Before Rarity can come out and see the chaos building inside the boutique, Twilight locks her in the window display room.   Twilight asks how all this happened, and the other ponies explain that they acted in accordance to what they believe Rarity wanted. Considering how well Rarity knows her closest friends, Twilight realizes she would want them to help in their own ways, not just Rarity's way. With this in mind, the ponies resolve to fix the mess they created.   Fluttershy allows the raccoons to stay in the building in return for a favor, Pinkie Pie appeals to DJ Pon-3, Rainbow Dash organizes a race between the potential employees, and Applejack helps Plaid Stripes make a unique contribution to the boutique. That evening, Twilight finally lets Rarity out of the window display room so she can behold the work her friends have done. Immensely pleased by their efforts, Rarity officially opens Rarity For You to the public. The employees that Rainbow Dash hired assist with the large crowd, DJ Pon-3 provides ambient music courtesy of Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy's raccoons and Plaid Stripes provide fancy snacks. With the help of Rarity's friends, the grand opening of Rarity For You is met with overwhelming success.    Back in present day, Rarity finishes reading the boutique opening's glowing review in her newspaper, reading about how the combination of Rarity's vision and her friends' expertise helped pull everything together. She asks the others why they didn't tell her there were so many problems, and they explain that they didn't want to burden her with a non-perfect grand opening.     "

The episode opens at the  , with   enjoying some time in the steam room.  , one of the spa employees, enters and warns Rarity not to stay in for too long or else she might get pruney. Rarity explains that she is waiting for   to arrive, as it has been some time since their last spa day together. Unfortunately, Applejack has spent so much time on her chores that, by the time she finally arrives, the spa is about to close up for the day, and Rarity's face has pruned beyond recognition.    Some time later, Rarity meets up with   and   on their way to   to pick up some fresh pies. She explains to the two about her troubles bringing Applejack out on a spa day and how extra busy Applejack is lately with her chores. They meet Applejack at the farm, and Applejack expresses how sorry she is about her chores taking up all of her time. She even adds that  ,  , and   are unable to lighten her workload due to having chores of their own. With this in mind, Twilight offers to help on the farm with Spike so Applejack and Rarity can have their spa day. Applejack is reluctant at first, but she soon gives in and grants Twilight and Spike one hour to complete one chore: feeding the pigs. She gives them a detailed step-by-step checklist on how to carry out the task.    As Applejack and Rarity make their way to the spa, Applejack worries a little about Twilight and Spike's ability to handle farm work, but Rarity assures her that they can handle an hour's worth. Upon arriving at the spa, the two discover   about to have her own spa treatment—though Rainbow desperately tries to play it off. Unfortunately for all three ponies, service at the spa is backed up. Despite Applejack's excitement for having a relaxing steam, the wait line for the steam room is considerably long. Aloe explains this is because the steam room has been taking longer to fill with steam lately, causing the spa to start providing customers with hot towels.   Using her labor expertise, Applejack traces the low steam problem to a pipe leak. The leak causes low steam pressure, leading to a longer wait time for the steam room, and providing customers with hot towels uses up the spa's hot water that would normally be used to create steam, thus forming a never-ending cycle. Unwilling to leave things as they are, Applejack steps in to fix the dilemma, despite only the hour of time she and Rarity have before returning to the farm. Thanks to Applejack's efforts, the spa is once again at quality efficiency, and the employees even have less loads of laundry to do. However, Applejack and Rarity have no more time left for their spa day. Rarity briefly chastises Aloe for failing to check for leaks, and Aloe confesses that they had gotten so used to the way things were, they were unable to see any problems.    Still concerned about Twilight and Spike's progress, Applejack and Rarity stop by the farm to check in on them before resuming their spa day. They arrive to the sight of Twilight and Spike dangling corn over the pigpen, as was stipulated in the checklist Applejack provided them with. Applejack takes over for the two and admits that a list doesn't always convey the proper method of doing something. As Rarity voices her disappointment in the spa day she and Applejack had, Applejack does a series of bizarre steps in order to feed the pigs, such as opening and closing the pen gate, babbling crazily at the pigs, and clucking like a chicken. While doing this, she expresses the sentiment of one getting stuck in a routine that puts extra, unnecessary work on oneself.   When Applejack's friends question her method for feeding the pigs, she explains that each step serves a purpose in addressing a possible problem. However, as Applejack herself points out, she had solved these problems long ago and therefore fell into her own unbreakable routine. With her friends' help, Applejack manages to streamline her chores and cut out the unnecessary steps through which she does them, thus giving her more free time.    With the extra free time given to her, Applejack decides to have a real spa day with Rarity, and she very much looks forward to an afternoon of relaxation. At the spa, the two encounter Rainbow Dash once again after she has had a session of pampering. After a bit of playful teasing, Applejack and Rarity invite Rainbow to join them, and she ""reluctantly"" accepts.      "

At that moment, Zephyr Breeze enters, excitedly greeting his older sister, briefly flirting with Rainbow Dash, and remarking on the failure of his latest business venture in mane therapy. Almost immediately, his presence is a burden on his parents as he moves his belongings in.

Lastly, Fluttershy brings Zephyr to Rainbow Dash, who gives him a simple job at  ' headquarters—with the threat of zapping him with lightning if he fails. He returns to Fluttershy's cottage later with a zapped mane, Rainbow having made good on her promise. With this string of failures behind him, Zephyr Breeze gives up.

Almost immediately, it summons   and   to  , causing Rarity to get overexcited.    Upon arriving in Canterlot, Rarity recommends starting their search for a friendship problem at the castle, but Pinkie proposes that they simply ""go with the flow"" and let a friendship problem find them. When Pinkie's stomach growls, Rarity suggests they begin with lunch, and she takes Pinkie to Canterlot's ""Restaurant Row"", home to some of Equestria's most renowned establishments of fine dining. As Rarity points out, most of the restaurants in the area have a ""three-hoof rating"" given by famous food critic  , whose opinion can make or break a restaurant's success. However, several of Rarity's restaurant choices offer poor-tasting food and nearly identical atmospheres.   Pinkie decides to choose the next restaurant, and she follows a delicious aroma to a small yet non-rated restaurant called The Tasty Treat. Inside, they meet chef  , who offers them some very tasty dishes. Saffron's father  , however, is ill-tempered due to the restaurant's lack of business. As a result, he and his daughter have a strained relationship, and they frequently argue. Pinkie Pie and Rarity believe this is the friendship problem they have been summoned for: to save Saffron and Coriander's restaurant and tense relationship. Rarity offers to use her connections in Canterlot to bring Zesty Gourmand, and Pinkie offers to help advertise.    A short while later, Rarity informs Saffron and Coriander that she successfully convinced Zesty Gourmand to visit The Tasty Treat. Unfortunately, Zesty is only available that very evening, giving Pinkie and Rarity only a few hours to get the restaurant ready. Rarity helps Coriander Cumin make the restaurant worthy of a three-hoof rating, and Pinkie and Saffron Masala drum up business in the streets. Through a Bollywood-style duet, Rarity convinces Coriander to make his restaurant just like the other establishments on Restaurant Row while Pinkie Pie tells Saffron Masala to embrace what makes The Tasty Treat unique and special.   After several hours, Pinkie and Saffron only manage to convince a tourist couple from   to visit The Tasty Treat. When they return to the restaurant, they discover that Rarity and Coriander have redecorated to make it resemble every other restaurant on the block, even copying their unappetizing menus. As Pinkie and Rarity argue over their conflicting creative directions, Zesty Gourmand arrives.  With Zesty's three-hoof rating looming over them, Coriander and Saffron—and by extension, Rarity and Pinkie—argue over what food to serve. Their escalating disagreements cause a bowl of curry to spill on Zesty. After some harsh words for both Rarity and the restaurant, Zesty angrily takes her leave.   Having failed in their friendship mission, Pinkie and Rarity apologize to Coriander for ruining his restaurant. In an effort to cheer her father up, Saffron serves him a dish he used to make when she was little. The two reminisce on old times, and Saffron expresses that all she has ever wanted to do was serve food to ponies that they used to make together. As Coriander and Saffron reconcile, Rarity realizes that Zesty Gourmand's opinion doesn't matter. She believes she and Pinkie can fix things by switching their previous roles; Rarity brings in the crowd while Pinkie returns The Tasty Treat to how it was before.   Through Pinkie and Rarity's efforts, The Tasty Treat is reverted to its former, more unique state, and numerous ponies show up for its ""grand re-reopening"". Saffron and Coriander thank the two for helping to revive not only their business but also their relationship.   When Zesty Gourmand wanders by the restaurant and sees its business is now booming, she enters to voice her displeasure, saying the establishment is below the standards of cuisine she has tried to set. Rarity and Pinkie argue that no one should tell other ponies what to think, not even Zesty. Inspired by Pinkie and Rarity's words, some of the other restaurant owners decide to cook what they want instead of following strict societal trends. As Zesty brushes off their opinions and leaves, Pinkie and Rarity's   glow to signify a mission success, and the celebration inside The Tasty Treat goes on.      "

The title is a reference to the saying "" "" and  , an in-universe example of the latter of which is  . In this episode,   attends a     and meets  , who hates Daring Do's post-book three stories as much as she loves them.   In production order, this is season six episode fourteen. This episode was initially teased by   voice actress Chiara Zanni in a direct message on Twitter in August 2015. In early June 2016, Latin American dub director   tweeted, ""No lo puedo creer! En un cap de MLP van a una convención!!! Y hay Ponies-fans!! Y hablan de sus cosplays jajaja esto sí que es increíble!!!"",  which, translated in English, indicated that there would be an episode where ponies go to a  -like convention, with Pony fans, and talking with cosplayers. On July 13, 2016,   revealed that stand-up comedian   would be providing the voice of  .  Oswalt himself later confirmed the reveal on  , adding that the episode has a   Easter egg. The episode was released eight hours early on the U.S. and Canadian Netflix service. The co-writer of the episode   revealed that Quibble Pants's monologue during the episode's end credits was all improvised by Oswalt.     The episode begins with   braving an underground temple's hazards to claim a rare artifact. This is revealed to a   story being read to   by   while Rainbow packs up for the Daring Do Convention in  . Twilight is upset that she is unable to attend the convention due to an upcoming friendship summit in  , but Rainbow promises to get A.K. Yearling to sign her book for her. Rainbow tries to downplay her excitement for the convention in front of Twilight, but she is overcome with excitement as soon as she arrives.   As Rainbow Dash wanders through the convention, a salespony briefly tries to sell her on the   ""adventu-cation"", but she declines, having already done it. Afterward, she meets a pony named  , who shares her fanatical passion for Daring Do. The two spend some time exploring the convention together and checking out various booths and activities.   During lunch, Rainbow suggests they check out convention activities relating to the Daring Do books that were released after the initial trilogy. Quibble refuses, however, claiming that the later books in the series are ""dumbed down"" and unrealistic. This leads to a heated argument between Rainbow and Quibble regarding the quality and realism of A.K. Yearling's subsequent writing, and Rainbow is unable to properly defend her points without revealing that Daring Do is a real pony. Unable to come to an agreement on the matter, the two decide that they cannot be friends and part ways.   At the hotel near the convention, Rainbow Dash searches for A.K. Yearling so she can prove to Quibble Pants that the Daring Do books are indeed realistic. When she meets with Yearling claiming to have an ""emergency"", Yearling pulls her into a hotel room, believing that   is somewhere at the convention. Yearling dismisses Rainbow's fan interests as she is more concerned with a key-shaped artifact she recently came into possession of and finding a lost treasure before Caballeron does.   Discarding her A.K. Yearling persona, Daring Do asks Rainbow Dash to keep a lookout for suspicious activity around the convention hall. As Rainbow returns to the convention, Dr. Caballeron lurks close by, blending in with cosplayers as he searches for Daring Do. Rainbow once again bumps into Quibble Pants, who continues to voice his distaste for the later Daring Do books. As Rainbow follows Caballeron and Quibble Pants follows her, Caballeron's   overhear them talking about Daring Do's artifact and capture them.    Caballeron and his henchponies drag Rainbow and Quibble out to a remote jungle, believing them to be working for Daring Do and intending to use them as bait to draw her in. However, Quibble believes the entire setup to be fake—that Rainbow Dash signed them up for a   adventu-cation and that Caballeron and his henchponies are merely actors. After the henchponies bind Rainbow and Quibble in chains, Quibble uses his intricate Daring Do savvy to lure the henchponies away and free himself and Rainbow. However, he still refuses to acknowledge that anything happening around him is real. Rainbow guides Quibble through the treacherous jungle, and it is only after Quibble nearly falls into raging rapids that he realizes his life is in genuine danger. Unfortunately, Caballeron and his henchponies quickly catch up with them, and through their unwitting help, Caballeron discovers the lost temple he had been searching for.   Caballeron and his henchponies drag Rainbow and Quibble into the temple, and Quibble still believes everything happening around him to be a performance. As he continues to voice his cynicism, he inadvertently triggers some traps that releases a monstrous   and slowly fills the temple chamber with mud. Once he is face-to-face with the Cipactli, Quibble comes to a frightening realization:  Caballeron traps Rainbow and Quibble in the mud chamber with the Cipactli, but Daring Do swoops to their rescue. Quibble is eager to escape the temple, but Daring Do says they have to find the treasure before Caballeron first.   Rainbow, Quibble, and Daring Do find themselves in a chamber with seven doors, behind only one of which lies the treasure. With Quibble Pants' cynical help, Daring Do opens the correct door with her key-shaped artifact and claims the temple's treasure. However, as mud starts to fill the room, the temple entrance is sealed off and the Cipactli slowly closes in. Using a vine to pull Quibble Pants along, Rainbow and Daring Do avoid the Cipactli and escape the temple through an open skylight. Once the three are outside the temple, they elude Caballeron and his henchponies by having the Cipactli chase them off.   Daring Do thanks both Rainbow Dash and Quibble Pants for their help and flies off to bring the temple treasure to a museum.   As Rainbow and Quibble return to civilization, Quibble admits that the later   books are more realistic than he realized, but he still does not like them. Before Rainbow can argue with him again, Quibble says he figured something out. While he prefers the intelligent and puzzle-solving Daring Do of the original trilogy and Rainbow prefers the brave and unbeatable Daring Do of the later books, it is okay for them to like the series in their own way, and neither of them are at fault for their personal preferences. Quibble also compliments Rainbow Dash for the bravery and awesomeness she demonstrated during their adventure. Rainbow returns the sentiment, complimenting Quibble for his perception and puzzle-solving skills. As they leave the jungle as friends, Quibble goes on an extended ramble about his   fan fiction that continues over the end credits.      "

Prior to the episode's premiere, a season six promotional image partially featuring the Applewood Derby racetrack was posted on the My Little Pony Facebook page on January 1, 2016,  and a promotional image featuring Applejack covered in grease was posted on April 2, 2016.     At the  , Miss   announces to her class of   that she is going to teach them about physics in order to prepare them for the upcoming Applewood Derby, in which the school foals will each build and race their own carts on a racetrack with an older pony assisting and riding with them. Cheerilee explains that cart racers will be awarded ribbons based on three categories: fastest cart, most traditional cart, and cart with the most creative design. Later, when school is dismissed,   researches old Applewood Derbies and wants to win first place for most traditional cart.   says that although the Derby is closely linked to   history and they usually win most traditional, she wants to win fastest cart. Lastly,   states she wants to win most creative cart as a change of pace from her high-speed scootering. The three fillies decide to seek help from their older sisters.    At  's  , Rainbow agrees to help Scootaloo build her cart, having fond memories of winning her own derby as a filly in  . However, she over-eagerly puts some of her own ideas to work as she goes to search for her own cart's blueprints. Similarly,   favors a traditional cart over Apple Bloom's desire for a modern and fast cart, and   takes charge of making Sweetie Belle's cart to make up for previously losing a first place ""Most Creative"" ribbon to  . Very early the next morning, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash take their little sisters to   to start building their derby carts. Unfortunately, the older ponies continue to project their own desires onto the Derby and disregard those of the Crusaders.   Though the fillies feel left out, they are certain that their older sisters know best. Their frustration only worsens, however, when Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow disapprove of and remove the additions they try to make to their respective carts. As the Applewood Derby is about to start, the Crusaders feel even more neglected when Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash take over as drivers of their carts, despite Derby tradition stating that foals drive the completed carts in the Derby.   The Applewood Derby participants and their older assistants assemble their carts at the starting line. In spite of the Crusaders' continued frustration at being left out of derby activities, they ride in the carts with their older sisters. Cheerilee, dressed in a derby cheerleader outfit, signals the start of the race, and Applejack and Apple Bloom are left far behind due to the outdated design of their traditional cart. As ponies race down the track, spectators sing a rousing song to cheer the racers on. Though their sisters excitedly sing along, the Crusaders have no fun in their roles as cart passengers. During the race, Rarity's cart blocks the other carts from passing. Near the finish line, Rainbow Dash's cart loses a tire, and the intersecting layout of the racetrack causes all of the carts to crash into each other.   The Crusaders finally vent their frustrations to their older sisters, saying they were supposed to design and drive their own carts in the Derby and that the older ponies ruined things for everyone due to their selfishness. When asked why they did not say anything earlier, the Crusaders say it's hard to speak up to ponies older than them and they figured ponies who participated in the Derby before knew what was best. Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity apologize to the Crusaders for getting carried away and ignoring their feelings. They also convince Cheerilee to agree to a second Applewood Derby to make up for the first—with the condition that the older ponies stay on the sidelines.    The three older sisters help the Crusaders build their carts exactly how they were initially envisioned; providing the help that was originally desired. The episode ends as Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Rarity relax on the sidelines of the second race, lamenting their decisions to partake in the race in the first place.    The Applewood Derby is a soapbox derby featured in the episode. In the event, colts and fillies build racing carts out of Sweet Apple Acres' applewood with the assistance of an older pony and race said carts on a town-wide racetrack with their cart-building assistants as their passengers.

As a result of Fluttershy losing track of time during their picnic, the group is forced to make their way home after dark. Suddenly, a monstrous-looking creature appears in the shadows before them, causing them to flee and cower in terror. When the creature comes out of the shadows, it is revealed to be   in disguise, pulling a prank. Though Rainbow is very amused by her own prank, Fluttershy finds no humor in it at all because she was scared. Rainbow Dash claims that Fluttershy is scared too easily, and when Fluttershy denies it, Rainbow scares her yet again just by saying the word ""boo"".    The next day, the Mane Six gather in the   throne room to discuss Rainbow's pranking habits. When Rainbow says her pranks are just harmless jokes, the others—except for  —argue that they are not harmless if the party being pranked is not amused. During this discussion, Rainbow pranks   with a whoopee cushion in her throne. Similar to the night before, Rainbow and Pinkie Pie laugh, but Twilight does not.  makes the argument that if Rainbow Dash cannot put forth the effort to pull off a prank that everyone can enjoy, she might as well not pull off any pranks at all. Rainbow perceives this as a challenge and leaves the castle to plan more pranks.   Later that day, Rarity enters her workshop to put the finishing touches on  's uniform for the upcoming   Cookie Drive. Inside, she finds the uniform standing atop a giant cake—with a note attached that reads ""You asked for it.""

Though Pinkie herself has already been pranked and found it funny, the rest of   think Rainbow Dash is getting too carried away. Because Pinkie shares Rainbow's love of pranks, the ponies ask her to tell Rainbow to stop, much to Pinkie's discomfort. Pinkie approaches Rainbow Dash at her  , but before she can tell her to stop pranking ponies, Rainbow shares her plans for her biggest prank yet. She plans to replace all the cookies being sold during the Filly Guide Cookie Drive with joke cookies that give everyone who eats them ""rainbow mouth"", causing their mouths and teeth to turn rainbow colors.

Rainbow Dash arrives to help out too, and Applejack warns her not to do anything that could potentially ruin the fillies' night. Rainbow promises to behave herself.   The Crusaders then spend several hours selling cookies door-to-door until almost all of their boxes have been sold. Rainbow Dash eagerly waits to see the results of her prank, but she notices that all of Ponyville has gotten eerily quiet. She flies around town looking through ponies' windows and sees cookies and cookie boxes scattered everywhere, but there are no ponies in sight. At Sugarcube Corner, she finds   in the kitchen eating cookies. When Mrs. Cake turns around, her mouth is covered in rainbow, and she groans like a cookie-craving zombie.

She races back to Applejack, Rarity, and the Crusaders before they too fall victim to this plague and beckons them to find a hiding place. Before long, the zombified ponies catch up, and Rainbow and the others flee in terror.    Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity, and the Crusaders board themselves up inside the barn at  , intending to wait until the effects of the cookie zombie plague wear off. However, the zombified ponies quickly surround the barn and pound at the doors and windows. Rainbow reveals to the others that she replaced the Filly Guide cookies with joke cookies as a prank, but she didn't intend for this to happen. Unfortunately, Rarity, Applejack, and the Crusaders have already eaten the joke cookies and have now turned into zombies as well, making Rainbow the only non-zombie left. The rest of the zombies break into the barn and close in on Rainbow. As she is backed into a corner, she admits that her prank was supposed to be funny, but this is not funny at all. With Rainbow's admission, the ponies suddenly drop the charade, having been only acting like zombies until now.   Applejack reveals that, after Rainbow told Pinkie of her plan to prank the whole town, Pinkie orchestrated the fake zombie plague to teach Rainbow a lesson. Because Rainbow doesn't see the humor in this prank, she realizes how she has been making everyone else feel with her own pranks.

Upon arrival to the Crystal Empire, Twilight, Starlight, and Spike find the train station and streets to be completely empty. As soon as Spike removes his disguise, Crystal Ponies appear to swarm him, cheering his name and pleading for him to save them once again. Twilight and Starlight ask what is going on, and the Crystal Ponies wonder to themselves if they are who they outwardly appear to be. When they begin to question if Spike is as   appears, they flee in terror. Outside the palace, Twilight, Starlight, and Spike are stopped by  —even Twilight's princess status and Spike's Empire reputation prevent them from getting through. When  ,  , and Sunburst enter, Cadance confirms Twilight's identity with their ""Sunshine, Sunshine"" dance.   Cadance, Shining Armor, and Sunburst explain that the Empire is in a state of panic because a   had recently been spotted.

Fearing for Flurry Heart's well-being, Twilight offers to help protect her.  Spike joins the royal guards' search for the changeling in the Arctic Wastes outside the Empire, and the guards defer to Spike's command. After splitting up the group to cover more ground, Spike stumbles into an underground cavern and nearly falls into a deep chasm. He is briefly startled by his own mirrored reflection, but his reflection turns out to be the changeling itself.   As Spike runs away from the changeling, he falls into the chasm, but the changeling saves him from plummeting to his doom. Spike is considerably confused by the changeling's act of charity. The changeling introduces himself as   and says that, ever since he was first hatched, he has always been different from his fellow changelings. Having taken part in the invasion on  , Thorax wanted to share its love instead of steal it. Since then, he has lived on his own in search of friends with which to share love, but his basic changeling instincts prevent him from venturing out into public. Having a reputation among the Crystal Ponies as a hero, Spike offers to speak to them on Thorax's behalf.    Spike returns to Shining Armor and the royal guards and says that he not only found the changeling but also befriended him. Unfortunately, the ponies are so disdainful toward changelings that they consider such a feat to be impossible and that Spike's ramblings are merely a joke. Spike returns to Thorax's cave to give the bad news, but he comes up with another plan. He brings Thorax to the castle under the guise of an average Crystal Pony and introduces him to Twilight as his pen pal ""Crystal Hoof"".

However, the love coming from all around her causes Thorax to succumb to his basic changeling instincts, and he inadvertently drops his disguise. The ponies immediately turn on Thorax, believing that he has taken ""Crystal Hoof""'s place. Surrounded by so many angry ponies, Spike is unable to bring himself to stand up for his new friend. Thorax runs away in tears, and the royal guards give chase.   As Shining Armor and the royal guards search for Thorax, Spike looks for him in his cave. Thorax comes out of hiding and hisses at Spike, giving up hope that a changeling can ever have friends. Spike apologizes for not standing up for him, and Thorax forgives him since he is such a respected hero to the Crystal Ponies. With that, Spike sets out to make things right.   Back at the palace, the royal guards search frantically for Thorax, believing that there may be other changelings hiding nearby. Suddenly, Spike appears before the ponies alongside Thorax. Before they can take any action, Spike says Thorax is his friend and expresses through heartfelt song that changelings are just as capable of change as any other creature. When the song ends, Twilight says she's proud of Spike for risking his celebrity status for a new friend. As the princess of friendship, she officially extends a warm hoof to Thorax, which he tearfully accepts. Having received the message of Spike's song, Cadance extends her hoof to Thorax as well on behalf of the Empire, and Shining Armor welcomes him as an official citizen.    As representative of the changelings, Thorax looks forward to learning all he can about friendship and bringing that knowledge back to the Changeling Kingdom so that changelings can learn to share love among themselves instead of stealing it from others.As the ponies cheer for Spike and Thorax, Starlight echoes Twilight's sentiment from the train: friendship lessons can happen anywhere.

Discord dismisses the notion of spending an evening with two ""sidekicks"", but Fluttershy says it would be a good opportunity for him to expand his circle of friends. Discord is still dismissive, but he takes it under consideration.    At the Ponyville train station, Discord's attempts to convince Fluttershy not to leave end in failure. The rest of the Mane Six soon arrive, and Spike and Big McIntosh see them off as they leave on the  . In Spike and Big Mac's company, Discord becomes awkwardly uncomfortable. When they approach him, he tries to back away until they invite him to join their ""Guys' Night"".

That evening, Spike and Big Mac are excited to begin their Guys' Night, and Discord makes a considerably flashy entrance. He expects a night of partying at Ponyville's rowdiest establishments, but Spike says they are staying in and playing games. Still excited, Discord suggests pony charades, but Spike and Big McIntosh instead sit down to play a game of  , much to Discord's horror.   Spike explains that   is a tabletop role-playing game in which players create their own fantasy avatars and take part in an imaginary adventure where decisions and outcomes are determined by dice rolls. During Spike's explanation, Discord affords only the barest of interest.   In the game, Spike is a wizard named ""Garbunkle"", and Big Mac is a unicorn knight named ""Sir McBiggun"". Their objective is to rescue ""Princess Shmarity"" from the evil  . In creating his own character, Discord disinterestedly chooses an archer named ""Captain Wuzz"". The game gets underway, and Discord immediately makes several unsuccessful decisions—mainly due to his lack of interest—and earns penalties to his character and imaginary ridicule. Angered by Spike and Big McIntosh's laughing, Discord seals Big Mac in a magic bubble and decides to show the two a   Guys' Night. Discord snaps his fingers and creates a swing jazz dance club, offering milkshakes and card games to Spike and Big Mac.

However, the dangers they face are now completely real, and Discord is in control of everything that happens. The evil Squizard and his forces—appearing as living cardboard drawings—arrive to attack Spike and Big Mac. Spike and Big Mac run away, and after briefly shielding themselves from a barrage of arrows, they take shelter in a cave. Discord appears before them, and Spike angrily chews him out for ruining his and Big Mac's game. When Discord asks why they invited him to join them in the first place, Spike reveals it is because they felt sorry for him. Discord promptly transports the three back to the castle throne room. Spike explains further that Fluttershy told them about his behavior before she left, and they invited him to join them out of courtesy.   Discord is mortified to discover that he is not as ""cool"" and respected as he initially thought he was, and he decides to leave while playing off his embarrassment. Spike and Big Mac return to their game but are unable to focus due to the circumstances of Discord's departure. They call Discord back to give him another chance, and Discord returns in an instant. He apologizes for ruining their evening, and Spike and Big Mac admit that the game was exciting when Discord made it real. They ask him to make a toned-down version of the   world, and he happily obliges.   Some time later, the Mane Six return from their trip to Yakyakistan and go to the Castle of Friendship, where they find Spike, Big Mac, and Discord playing a real-life version of  .

On Twitter in late August 2016,   joked about this episode's featured character(s) being ""{2>\{¦<U+25CF>{~""  and/or ""incidental Appleoosa[ ] pony #7"".     The episode opens with   bucking apples at a bull's-eye. When   appears and asks what she is doing, Applejack explains that she is practicing her ""distance bucking"". According to Applejack, her cousin   recently made the boast that his team in   could beat  's team at the   of buckball. Rainbow Dash takes offense at such a challenge and eagerly volunteers to defend Ponyville's honor by joining the Ponyville buckball team.   Later that day, Applejack and Rainbow Dash bring   and   to Sweet Apple Acres. Rainbow is now swept up by buckball fever, and Applejack is determined to meet Braeburn's challenge by assembling a team to beat his. Because Braeburn has a   and a   on his team, Applejack and Rainbow decide to hold tryouts to find an ideal third member—with Pinkie Pie on Rainbow's practice team and Fluttershy on Applejack's. On Sweet Apple Acres' buckball field, Applejack assembles several unicorn ponies together and explains how the game is played: Earth ponies play offense and try to buck softballs into their team's goal basket; Pegasi play defense and try to block the ball from going into the other team's goal before passing it back to the Earth pony on their team; and unicorns play assistance to offense team members by levitating the goal basket and catching incoming balls in the outfield.   As practice gets underway, none of the unicorns trying out meet Applejack and Rainbow Dash's expectations. However, Pinkie Pie displays a great talent for playing offense, and Fluttershy is good at blocking goal shots with her tail. As   walks by carrying a pair of water buckets, Pinkie Pie accidentally bucks several balls at him, but he effortlessly catches them in his buckets. Applejack bucks several more balls at Snails, and he catches those in a basket as well. With the talent Snails has for catching goal shots, Applejack and Rainbow Dash decide that Ponyville's buckball team should consist of Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Snails.   Fluttershy and Pinkie are uncertain about playing against Appleloosa in Applejack and Rainbow's place at first, but they agree once they realize how much fun they had playing. In order to prepare the two for the upcoming game, Applejack and Rainbow put them through rigorous training.   Rainbow Dash compels Fluttershy to run an elaborate obstacle course, and Applejack tosses softballs at Pinkie to kick into goal baskets. The intensity of the training and Rainbow Dash's drill sergeant-like coaching cause Fluttershy to frequently trip up. When Applejack piles onto Pinkie the pressure of not letting Ponyville down, Pinkie gets so overwhelmed that she cannot make successful goal shots anymore. Snails, on the other hand, remains perfectly calm and collected as he practices catching balls in the goal. Applejack and Rainbow Dash are surprised by Fluttershy and Pinkie's sudden lack of talent after the skills they demonstrated earlier. Reasoning that they just need some rest, the two coaches call it a day and tell them to rest up for the next day's buckball game. On their way home, Pinkie and Fluttershy confide in each other about their worries of letting their friends down. However, they take relief in the fact that very few ponies in Ponyville have even heard of buckball... ...until numerous ponies show up at the train station to cheer for the Ponyville team and see them off to Appleloosa.    After their big send-off at the train station, Applejack, Rainbow, Fluttershy, and Pinkie ride the   to Appleloosa. Fluttershy and Pinkie's anxieties are made even worse when Applejack mentions that Ponyville is planning a parade for their return and Rainbow suggests the possibility of a commemoration by  . Unable to deal with the overwhelming pressure of disappointing their friends, Fluttershy and Pinkie confess to Applejack and Rainbow that they don't want to play buckball anymore, and they run away upset. Applejack and Rainbow come to realize that they focused so heavily on what made the game important to them that they ruined what made it fun for Fluttershy and Pinkie. After finding the two hiding in the train's luggage car, Applejack and Rainbow tell them that they don't have to play against Appleloosa and that they will take their places instead. However, because they have not had any practice themselves, they ask Fluttershy and Pinkie to play one practice game against them before the game against Appleloosa starts.   On a buckball field near Appleloosa, Applejack and Rainbow have a practice game against Fluttershy, Pinkie, and Snails. With the pressure of letting Ponyville down no longer on their shoulders, Fluttershy and Pinkie are able to play much better. Applejack and Rainbow reveal that their ""practice"" was set up to help show how amazing Fluttershy and Pinkie are when they have fun, and apologize for putting the two under so much stress to win. When Fluttershy and Pinkie still worry about letting their friends down, Snails advises them to simply not think about it – an approach that they eagerly agree with.   Some time later, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Snails play against Braeburn's team in buckball, and the score is tied five-to-five. When Fluttershy and Pinkie worry about winning, their friends remind them not to think about it and just have fun. In the final seconds of the game, Fluttershy and Pinkie manage to score a point and win the game. Braeburn commends the Ponyville team for playing such a good game and resolves to get serious for their rematch. Fluttershy and Pinkie tell him not to get   serious, however, as the secret to good buckball is just having fun.      "

Later that day, the Crusaders make their way through Ponyville, proud of the many cutie mark problems they have helped other ponies with, such as  ,  , and  . On their way to their clubhouse, Sweetie Belle wonders if they will ever encounter an unsolvable problem when Apple Bloom spots a   perched atop the clubhouse. The fillies are alarmed since griffons are usually unfriendly and short-tempered. But when the griffon sees them, she greets them with a big, enthusiastic hug.   The griffon introduces herself as Gabriella—or   for short. Having heard about the Crusaders solving cutie mark problems around Ponyville, she says she has been searching for them in order to get a cutie mark of her very own. Inside the clubhouse, Gabby explains to the Crusaders that she has always felt out of place among the more antisocial griffons while working as a mail courier in  . When   and    , Gabby observed them teaching   about friendship and was convinced that their cutie marks were related to their desire to help others. So when Gilda needed a letter delivered to Rainbow Dash in Ponyville, Gabby jumped at the opportunity. She met with several ponies around town that the Crusaders helped and sought the fillies out so they could help her find her true purpose in life and get her own cutie mark.   The Crusaders are at a loss as they have never heard of a griffon getting a cutie mark, but Gabby remains optimistic. While she goes to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash, the Crusaders consult   at the   for advice. However, not even Twilight has any knowledge of creatures other than ponies who can get cutie marks, and she reminds the fillies that using magic to make a cutie mark appear is never a good idea.  The Crusaders decide to tell Gabby that, while it is unlikely she will ever get a cutie mark, they can still help her find her purpose in life. Unfortunately, Gabby misinterprets them to mean that getting a cutie mark is guaranteed and becomes more ecstatic than ever. Even after the Crusaders explain to her what Twilight told them, Gabby maintains that it is not impossible.   Scootaloo sympathizes with Gabby because of her own difficulties of achieving flight and promises to help her realize her dream of getting a cutie mark, much to Gabby's delight. Using a chart to map out various possibilities for Gabby's purpose, the Crusaders lead her in song as she seeks out other ponies struggling with their own problems. Gabby demonstrates great aptitude for a variety of activities, but her cutie mark shows no signs of appearing. The Crusaders come to realize that Gabby is good at so many things, singling out her special talent is truly impossible. When they tell Gabby the harsh reality that they she will never get a cutie mark, she flies off in tearful denial.    As the Crusaders wallow in their first failure at solving a cutie mark problem, Gabby bursts into the clubhouse and reveals that she earned her cutie mark after all. She shows off her cauldron cutie mark and reasons that, since helping   brew potions was the first thing she tried, that must be her special talent. The Crusaders are elated and decide to tell Twilight the good news. However, Gabby suddenly becomes nervous at this suggestion and promises to meet the Crusaders at Twilight's castle after delivering Rainbow Dash's reply letter to Gilda. The Crusaders go to the castle to inform Twilight about Gabby's cutie mark, but Twilight tells them that Gabby left them a note before quickly departing. As the Crusaders read Gabby's note aloud, in which she thanks the fillies for helping her earn a cutie mark, Twilight excitedly drops everything to research the first cutie marked griffon in history. Realizing that Gabby broke her promise, the Crusaders become suspicious and go to find her.   The three find Gabby helping   get his cart out of a mud puddle. When she trips and falls in the mud, her cutie mark is revealed to be fake. Gabby apologizes for lying about getting her cutie mark and admits that she did so to cheer up the Crusaders after they failed to help her. Before she leaves for Griffonstone in shame, Scootaloo gets an idea and tells her to meet them at the clubhouse.   Later at the clubhouse, Gabby wonders that since she cannot get a cutie mark, she may not have a purpose in life. However, the Crusaders tell her that she   have a talent for helping others in need, even the Crusaders themselves. Gabby says that helping others is just something that she enjoys, and the fillies tell her what makes her talent special is what she enjoys doing most, which she doesn't need a cutie mark for.   In recognition of her talent, the Crusaders give her a makeshift cutie mark in the form of two mailbag clips modeled after their own marks. With this, they welcome Gabby as the first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Some time later, all of Ponyville throws Gabby a   to celebrate her cutie mark.

Applejack thinks the city will not be as bad as she believes, but when she and Fluttershy arrive, they find it to be even noisier and more crowded than they imagined.   At a Las Pegasus luxury resort filled with games and carnival rides, Applejack and Fluttershy are overwhelmed by all the excitement and activity, believing that   or   would be more suited to such an environment. Applejack suggests they solve the friendship problem they were summoned to solve quickly so they can return home. As they explore the resort, they hear a barker pony promoting an event called   and crediting the event's sponsoring to the owner of the resort,  .   Gladmane himself appears to greet Applejack and Fluttershy, pleased to meet the friends of Princess Twilight Sparkle. Calling himself a ""friendship connoisseur"", Gladmane credits the success of his resort to friendship and hard work. He offers to give the two a tour of the resort, and they accept so they can find the friendship problem they were called to solve. In a backstage area, Applejack and Fluttershy meet several performers in  , including a trapeze artist, the trapeze artist's director, and a pair of exotic animal trainers. The ponies they meet have nothing but praise and admiration for Gladmane.    At the end of the tour, Applejack and Fluttershy are surprised to find that everyone in Las Pegasus gets along very well. All of a sudden, they hear the familiar voices of   promoting  . However, while Flim promotes the event's acrobatics act, Flam promotes the exotic animal act, and the two appear to be on sour terms. Fluttershy believes this is the friendship problem they were called for, but Applejack vehemently refuses to help them. Gladmane explains to Applejack and Fluttershy that Flim and Flam have been arguing ever since they arrived at his resort. While he compliments Flim's showmanship and Flam's business sense, Applejack says they are better apart than together. Fluttershy suggests they help Flim and Flam, but Applejack still refuses and leaves to find other ponies with friendship problems.   Fluttershy speaks with Flim and Flam one-on-one and learns they had a falling-out over harsh words and a disagreement in business direction. Fluttershy tries to get them to reconcile their differences, but they refuse to even speak to each other. Meanwhile, Applejack discovers other arguments being had between the   performers. A stagehand and one of the animal trainers state that the arguments between them prevent them from finding greater success outside of Gladmane's resort.   Applejack and Fluttershy meet up later in the resort cafeteria and share their surprise in finding three friendship problems in the same place. They also realize that the ponies' arguing only serves to benefit Gladmane—as long as they argue, they are forced to stay at his resort and make him money. However, when they talk to the performers about Gladmane's possible double dealings, the performers deny such claims and only praise the resort owner further. Applejack and Fluttershy's suspicions about Gladmane are confirmed when Fluttershy speaks with the animals featured in  : Gladmane deliberately causes arguments between the show performers in order to keep them working for him. But because he does it behind the ponies' backs, they remain ignorant to his deceit. Applejack wonders how to expose Gladmane's lies, and Fluttershy proposes they fight trickery with trickery by getting help from Flim and Flam.   Despite Applejack's reluctance, she and Fluttershy decide to help Flim and Flam reconcile. However, Flim and Flam do not believe their claim that Gladmane drove them apart. When asked precisely how they started fighting in the first place, Flim explains Gladmane told him that Flam thinks he is just a mouthpiece with no good ideas. Similarly, Flam heard from Gladmane that Flim thinks he has zero business sense. However, each brother's only proof that the other said such things is based on what Gladmane told them. Applejack and Fluttershy assert that Gladmane keeps them apart in order to keep them from taking over his resort. Realizing that Applejack would never lie about such a thing, Flim and Flam agree to help them expose Gladmane's lies.   Following Flim and Flam's plan, Fluttershy disguises herself as wealthy pony ""Impossibly Rich"", with Flam posing as her guide. Flim informs Gladmane that Impossibly Rich is scouting locations to build a resort of her own and cut in on Gladmane's business. Feeling threatened, Gladmane enters to give Impossibly Rich a tour and asks Flam to meet him later in his office.   In Gladmane's office, Gladmane shares with Flam his intentions to own multiple resorts on the Las Pegasus resort strip and the threat that Impossibly Rich poses to such plans, revealing his crooked side. Later, as Gladmane shows Impossibly Rich around the resort, she and Flam try to get him to reveal the true, dishonest secret to his success using a microphone that Applejack and Flim have set up. Unfortunately, Gladmane sees through their ruse and laughs as he walks away.  Later, Applejack and Fluttershy confront Gladmane in his office directly and tell him to stop exploiting ponies' disagreements to his own ends. However, Gladmane gloats that his duplicitous form of friendship will soon bring all of Las Pegasus under his control, and that, as a professional conpony, he is always one step ahead. Unfortunately, Fluttershy had her hoof pressed on Gladmane's loudspeaker button the entire time he was talking, revealing his true nature to everyone in the resort.   The   performers reconcile their arguments and subsequently quit as Gladmane's employees, ruining his business and reputation. Applejack and Fluttershy's   start to glow, indicating a successful friendship mission, and they realize it was Applejack's history with Flim and Flam and Fluttershy's inclinations toward kindness that helped them see it through. With Gladmane no longer managing the resort, Flim and Flam quickly step in to take over, much to Applejack and Fluttershy's frustration.      "

Starlight Glimmer's Castle of Friendship bedroom was designed by Laura Bifano and Tanya Lehoux.     The episode begins at the   in the early morning.   prepares to quiz her pupil   with a full day's worth of magic spells to perform, including rapid teleportation to multiple locations, object transfiguration, and magic shields. Starlight excels at her magic studies with Twilight, even using advanced spells to go incredibly fast and duplicate herself. However, Twilight points out that Starlight hasn't addressed any friendship lessons since she befriended  . Becoming uneasy, Starlight says she will find the time to tackle some between her ""many commitments"". Twilight says now is the perfect opportunity since she and   are expected in   to give a presentation at  's  . She suggests that Starlight complete a friendship lesson before they return later that evening.   Though Starlight outwardly insists that it will be no problem, her unease around Twilight – and later Spike – indicate otherwise. In her castle bedroom, she has several friendship problems planned out: baking with  , scrap-booking with  , sewing with  , helping animals with  , and ""chillaxing"" with  .  A short while later, after Twilight and Spike have left, Starlight Glimmer gathers the rest of the Mane Six at the castle to carry out her friendship lessons with them. Applejack advises Starlight to take her time with her lessons, but Starlight is certain she can handle it as long as they work as a team.   She assigns Pinkie Pie to the kitchen, Applejack and Rarity to the library, and Fluttershy and her animals to the castle foyer. However, Rarity has reservations about sewing in a dusty environment, and Fluttershy's animals each require specific habitats. In addition, Rainbow Dash suggests ""specific conditions for optimal chillaxing"", and Applejack has over eighty  ' worth of photos to scrapbook. Starlight is overwhelmed by the taxing requirements of the friendship lessons before her, and she retreats to the library. As she worries about completing her lessons in time for Twilight's return, Starlight decides to use magic to lighten her stressful workload. Using the   spell in conjunction with   and  , she brings her friends under her direct control.   With the ponies now under her control, Starlight directs them to the locations in the castle that she originally assigned them to, and they follow without question or hesitation. First, she bakes in the kitchen with Pinkie Pie, and Pinkie simply follows Starlight's orders in a cheerful, stilted tone. In the library, Rarity and Applejack exhibit identical behavior, doing whatever Starlight tells them to do, and Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash do the same in the foyer.   As time goes on, however, Starlight grows bored of Applejack's long-winded stories, Rarity takes Starlight's orders too literally while sewing clothes, Pinkie Pie makes a large mess in the kitchen, and Fluttershy gets carried away in her animal care by bringing together all of the spiders and snakes in the castle. To make matters worse, Starlight accidentally fills the castle with smoke when she leaves the cakes in the kitchen oven unattended. Starlight commands Rainbow Dash to get water, and she responds by bringing storm clouds into the castle and causing a flood. Just as Starlight Glimmer thinks the situation could not get any worse, Twilight and Spike return from Canterlot to behold the big mess in the castle.    As Twilight and Spike clean up Starlight's mess, Starlight tries to figure out what went wrong with her spell. She believes she did not cast it correctly or reverse its effects earlier than she was supposed to, but Twilight and Spike agree that she is missing the point. When asked how things got as out of control as they did, Starlight admits that she has been deliberately avoiding her friendship lessons. Though she excels greatly at magic, she feared failing such simple tasks as baking with Pinkie or sewing with Rarity and thus letting Twilight down. However, Twilight points out that the purpose of her friendship lessons is to get to know other ponies better, not to complete tasks as baking or sewing.   At the  , the rest of the Mane Six are left suffering from hangover-like fatigue by the lingering effects of Starlight's magic. When Starlight approaches them, they express how upset they are at Starlight using her magic to mind-control them. Starlight accepts the consequences of her actions and offers her sincerest apologies to her friends. Before she leaves, the ponies see how genuinely sorry she feels. They offer to help her clean up the mess she made at the castle and give her a second chance for them to have fun together.   Over the course of the day, Starlight spends time with each of Twilight's friends, getting to know them better while Twilight supervises. She fixes up the castle tapestries with Rarity, listens to Applejack's family anecdotes, helps Fluttershy find a home for the castle spiders, and bakes with Pinkie Pie. As she finishes tidying up the castle, Starlight says it may be a while before she tries addressing any friendship problems, but Twilight says she has been doing so all day without realizing. The only task that remains is ""chillaxing"" with Rainbow Dash. Starlight Glimmer, Mane Six, and Spike conclude their day by lounging together on the castle roof, and Twilight commends Starlight for completing another friendship lesson. As Starlight asks how long they need to ""chillax"", the eight friends share a laugh.      "

When there's a knock at the door, Twilight expects her friends to enter, but their pets,  ,  , and   enter instead. Each pet offers a letter or message to Twilight saying that each of her invited friends refuse to attend a tea party that the other two are also attending. Twilight decides that if her friends will not come to her and explain what happened on their boat trip,   will go to   instead.   Twilight and Spike start at  , where Rarity is still combing the seaweed and crabs out of her mane and bemoaning the ruined state of her overcoat. Twilight—after giving Spike his scroll and quill again—asks Rarity what happened on the boat trip, and Rarity explains that ""it all started at the docks"".   In a flashback, Rarity meets with Applejack and Pinkie Pie at the Seaward Shoals docks, having planned a surprise cruise for the three of them to help get them out of their element. However, while Pinkie Pie remains the same in Rarity's retelling, Applejack strangely exhibits the appearance and characteristics of a salty seafaring captain. When the three get out onto the open sea, Rarity treats her friends to a tray of fancy dishes and hors d'oeuvres such as cucumber sandwiches, and Pinkie Pie offers assorted sugary treats. Rarity offers a cucumber sandwich to Pinkie Pie, before she can try it, Applejack tosses the entire tray of food overboard and laughs it off. Twilight and Spike agree that doesn't sound like something Applejack would do. Rarity continues that Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with party games.   Pinkie raises a piñata on the ship and gives Rarity the first turn, but the ship starts to sail into stormy waters. Now wearing a handkerchief like an eye patch, Applejack steers the ship directly into the heart of the storm. Rarity tells Applejack to steer toward calmer waters, leading to an argument over the map that Pinkie soon joins. As the three fight over the map, a giant tidal wave suddenly appears to capsize and sink the ship. Twilight is skeptical about Applejack getting sea madness and deliberately causing the ship to sink, believing that Rarity is embellishing on some details. Before Spike can learn how the three even made it back to shore, Rarity suggests they hear Pinkie's side of the story since she can corroborate.   At  , Pinkie denies Rarity's retelling of the events of the trip, saying   was the one who caused the ship to sink. Like Rarity's story, Pinkie's story ""started on the docks"".   In a second flashback, Pinkie meets with Applejack and Rarity at the Seaward Shoals docks, having planned a big boat party to help get them out of their element. In Pinkie's retelling, Applejack doesn't talk as much like a salty sea dog as in Rarity's retelling, but Rarity dresses like an extravagant seafarer with over a dozen ponies carrying her luggage. Soon after the three set sail, Pinkie offers a tray of sugary party treats, but Rarity rudely dismisses them as ""simple"" and replaces them with her tray of fancy hors d'oeuvres. She stuffs a cucumber sandwich in Pinkie's mouth, and before Applejack can help herself to the dishes, Rarity tosses them overboard, claiming ""cucumber sandwiches are so ten seconds ago"". As with Rarity's story, Twilight says that Rarity would never act in such a manner. Pinkie continues that she tried to lighten the mood with party games.   After Pinkie sets up the piñata, she offers Rarity a turn, but Rarity laughs her off. Applejack volunteers to have a turn, but just as the blindfold is put on her, the ship starts to sail into stormy waters. As Applejack and Rarity argue over the map, Pinkie mistakes it for a game of tug-of-war and joins in. At that moment, the giant tidal wave appears. Despite Rarity's claim that ""luxury cruises never sink"", the ship capsizes. Twilight finds Pinkie's retelling of the boat trip's events to be just as farfetched as Rarity's, and Pinkie tells her to get Applejack's side of the story. Spike again tries to learn how the three made it back to shore, but before Pinkie can explain, she is interrupted by muffins burning in the oven.   At  , Applejack refutes Rarity   Pinkie's accounts of the trip's events by claiming they were both responsible for the ship sinking.   In a third flashback, Applejack meets with Pinkie and Rarity at the Seaward Shoals docks, having planned a treasure hunt to help get them out of their element. In Applejack's retelling, Rarity dresses and acts even more extravagantly, and Pinkie appears to be dimwitted. After the trio sets sail, Pinkie and Rarity ignore Applejack's efforts to bring them adventure by focusing on their snacks. Before Pinkie can devour Rarity's entire tray of hors d'oeuvres, Applejack trips over a volleyball and accidentally knocks it overboard, earning disdain from both of her shipmates. As with Rarity and Pinkie's stories, Twilight and Spike believe that they would never act like that. Applejack's story continues familiarly with Pinkie's mood-lightening party games.   After setting up the piñata, Pinkie offers a turn to Rarity, but she brushes her off. Instead, Pinkie gives Applejack a turn by blindfolding her without warning. As the ship sails into stormy waters, Applejack tries to correct the ship's course using the map, but Rarity takes the map to use as a tablecloth. They fight over the map, and Pinkie joins shortly after. Like the previous two stories, it ends with the large tidal wave capsizing and sinking the ship. Upon finishing her story, Applejack resolves to never speak to Rarity or Pinkie again until they apologize. Twilight and Spike worry how they are going to get their friends to make amends if they all blame each other for the disastrous trip.   Back at the Castle of Friendship, Twilight tries to piece together the boat trip's true course of events based on her friends' different accounts and what they had in common. When she thinks she realizes what truly happened, Twilight has an idea to get her friends to reconcile.   Twilight summons Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie back to Seaward Shoals for a ""friendship emergency"", and they are immediately annoyed to have all been called to the same place. As they argue over who caused the ship to sink, Spike finally demands an answer as to how they made it back to shore. They admit that they hadn't taken the ship very far out to sea, and they simply swam back to the docks. With that answered, Twilight offers to show her friends how she believes the ship   sank. Once the ponies are out to sea, Twilight explains that her friends' stories all shared a common thread: cucumber sandwiches. She tosses the sandwich into the sea and points out another common thread in her friends' stories: the bubbling sea water and the sudden shift in weather. As it turns out, cucumber sandwiches are the favorite food of the  , and the tidal wave that sank the ship was caused by the bunyip surfacing from deep water. Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie are skeptical of this claim until the bunyip appears before them and expresses regret for sinking the ponies' ship.   However, Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie point out the rudeness they showed each other before the ship sank. Twilight explains that each of them was so focused on bringing the other two out of their element that they failed to notice the others doing the same. As a result of this lack of communication, their activity ideas inadvertently clashed. The three ponies are touched by the trouble that their friends went to enjoy themselves on the boat trip and make amends. The ponies and Spike share a group hug and even invite the bunyip to join in.   In the final scene, the ponies and Spike have a do-over on their boat trip and have fun doing the different activities that Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie originally planned, ending with a round of ice cream. Twilight expresses to Spike that ""there's nothing like a luxurious adventure boat party to get you out of your element"". She replaces Spike's scroll and quill with an ice cream goblet, and Spike agrees with the sentiment.      "
"Where the Apple Lies","Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp","2016-10-08","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Where_the_Apple_Lies"," is the twenty-third   of   of   and the one hundred and fortieth overall. The title is a reference to the 2003 novel and 2005 film  . In this episode,   shares the embarrassing story of how she came to value honesty after her lies almost jeopardized  's livelihood.   In early August 2016,   was asked if an earlier   synopsis for this episode was true and answered that it was not. The episode was originally scheduled to premiere on the United Kingdom channel   on October 5, 2016 at 8:00 AM BST (07:00 UTC),  three days ahead of its scheduled airing on  ; however, Tiny Pop changed it to a rerun of  , similarly to      , due to featuring  . In the   version of the episode, all instances of ""cider"" are replaced with ""juice"" or ""juicing"",  with some re-recorded lines and altered lip-syncing. However, Netflix subtitles maintain the original transcribing of ""cider"". The change can also be found on Disc 4 of the Season 6 DVD box set.    The episode opens with   and   giving   his yearly supply of zap apple jam as part of the arrangement between the   and Rich's Barnyard Bargains. Inside the barn,  , eager to take on more responsibility around  , has packed all of the cider to be sold during cider season in crates. However, the cider crates are identical to the zap apple jam crates given to Filthy Rich.   Applejack asks Apple Bloom if she kept track of what went into each crate, and Apple Bloom nervously assures her that she did. When Applejack discovers zap apple jam in the cider crates, Apple Bloom's little white lie is exposed. After the mix-up with Filthy Rich is straightened out, Applejack asks Apple Bloom why she lied. Apple Bloom explains that she wanted to fix things before anyone found out. Applejack says she knows from experience that lies only create trouble. Big McIntosh and   support this by claiming Applejack was a compulsive liar when she was a filly and that her lies once landed the Apple family in the hospital.    In a flashback to Applejack's youth, she and Big McIntosh argue frequently over who would run Sweet Apple Acres more efficiently—Applejack was more idea-oriented while Big Mac, being far more talkative as a teenage colt, valued physical strength. Granny Smith interrupts their arguing and tells them to go into town and buy more blight spray before a recent outbreak of apple blight ruins their entire apple crop for cider season. As Applejack and Big Mac enter  , they meet   and his fiancée,  . Spoiled is haughty toward the Apple siblings, but Filthy informs her of the close relationship between the Apple family and Rich family dating back to when Ponyville was first founded.   Having inherited Rich's Barnyard Bargains from his father, Filthy has ideas that he wants to implement to bring the store more business, such as selling the Apple family's cider during cider season. Applejack is intrigued by this idea, but Big Mac says Granny Smith is a tradition-upholding stickler about Sweet Apple Acres being the sole cider seller in Ponyville. Because Filthy appreciates Applejack's ideas more than Big Mac, Applejack agrees to give him three barrels of cider to start out and to give him more if those sell well.  When Applejack and Big McIntosh return to the farm with blight spray, Applejack informs Granny Smith of the deal she made with Filthy Rich, but Granny refuses to allow the Rich family to sell Apple family cider, noting the slower expiration of zap apple jam compared to cider. Having already made her promise to Filthy Rich, Applejack asks Granny to make an exception, but Granny still refuses, especially with the spread of apple blight dwindling the family's crop.   Applejack and Big Mac go to Filthy Rich's store, with Big Mac expressing ""I-told-you-so's"" along the way. At Filthy's store, Filthy has already set up a display to sell the Apple family's cider. When Applejack tells him that she has to back out of their previous arrangement, Filthy takes offense and chastises her for not keeping her word. He goes so far as to consider cutting all business ties between their two families. Desperate to keep relations between the Apples and Riches stable, Applejack claims that Granny Smith is sick and unable to manage the farm as well as she normally does. Filthy Rich takes this into consideration and understands Applejack backing out of their deal.    Later that evening, as the Apple family sits down for dinner, Big McIntosh has more harsh words for Applejack for making the situation worse by lying. While Granny Smith is busy in the kitchen, Filthy Rich and Spoiled Milk stop by to convey get-well wishes to the supposedly sick Granny. Before they discover the elderly mare is not sick, Applejack distracts Granny by having her go out to the barn and do inventory on the blight sprayers. Once Granny is kept occupied, Applejack compels Filthy and Spoiled to leave, stating that Granny is too sick to see visitors. Unfortunately, she is almost caught in her lies a second time, and she distracts Granny further with old family anecdotes. Applejack goes on to tell Filthy and Spoiled that Granny is suffering from apple blight—an affliction thought to only affect trees—and has been admitted to the  .   Filthy Rich and Spoiled Milk suddenly leave to go visit Granny Smith at the hospital, making the situation even worse. To counter this development, Applejack convinces Granny Smith that she is needed at the hospital because ponies have started to become afflicted with apple blight and the doctors need her expertise on how to cure it. Before Big Mac can say anything in protest, Applejack stuffs an apple in his mouth.   At Ponyville Hospital, Applejack brings Granny Smith inside through the back door to avoid being seen by Filthy Rich and Spoiled Milk. She then dresses Granny up in a hospital gown and surgical mask to ""protect"" her from the apple blight outbreak. At the front desk, Applejack meets with Filthy and Spoiled, who are unable to find Granny's hospital room. Applejack gives them a series of convoluted directions to keep them distracted further.   Returning to Big Mac and Granny Smith, Applejack tries to get Big Mac to pose as Granny in a hospital bed so Filthy and Spoiled can see her quickly and leave. Fed up, Big Mac tells Applejack that the situation is spiraling out of control and goes on a lengthy and emotional rant. Applejack, equally fed up with Big Mac's ""I-told-you-so's"", tells him that she's no longer concerned about realizing her ideas and just wants to preserve the relationship between the Apples and Riches. Reluctantly, Big Mac agrees to go along with Applejack's lie and keep silent. Before Filthy and Spoiled discover the non-sick Granny again, Applejack shoves her into a supply closet. She then takes Filthy and Spoiled to visit Granny in the room where Big Mac is posing as her, but by this time, one of the doctors has wheeled his gurney away. Applejack tells Filthy and Spoiled to follow the gurney while she retrieves Granny from the supply closet. As she searches the hospital for Big McIntosh, she comes across a surgery viewing room, and Granny is mistaken for a doctor about to perform surgery on Big Mac.   Granny Smith believes she is giving a presentation on apple blight, and she mistakes Big Mac's hooves for rotted tree branches. Before she amputates Big Mac's hooves with a saw, Applejack puts a stop to everything and confesses her lies. She explains that she made promises to Filthy Rich that she couldn't deliver and told lie after lie in order to maintain the Apple family's business ties with him. Big Mac accepts some of the blame for being more of a talker instead of a listener, and he and Applejack reconcile over their earlier arguing. However, after everything that has happened, Granny Smith is certain she'll be in charge of the farm for a long time, and she warns Filthy Rich not to cut any ties with the Apple family or else she'll inform his grandfather.    The flashback ends, and Apple Bloom is surprised to learn how much of a liar Applejack was when she was younger. Though Applejack is not proud of the incident, it did instill in her the values of honesty, which Apple Bloom also now appreciates. With everyone in agreement that Granny is the one who really runs Sweet Apple Acres, Granny tells her grandchildren to get back to work...     "

At the  ,   finishes her spring training with   and looks forward to spending her time off with her friends.   briefly laments being stuck at the academy during her time off training new academy recruits before Rainbow reminds her that she loves yelling and blowing her whistle. On her way home to  , Rainbow Dash's   suddenly starts glowing, indicating that she is being summoned by the  . She flies to the  , where   tells her that she has been summoned by the map as well. Unfortunately, the map is calling the two to where Rainbow Dash just came from: the Wonderbolt Academy.    Twilight and Rainbow fly to the academy, where Spitfire instructs a small group of   for the academy's week of trials. When Twilight and Rainbow appear, the trainees are excited to meet the Princess of Friendship and the most recent full-fledged member of the Wonderbolts before Spitfire commands them to do laps. When Spitfire asks why Rainbow has returned to the academy so soon, she explains that she is on ""official friendship business"". Twilight asks Spitfire if she's noticed any ponies having friendship problems, but Spitfire says she hasn't. As the trainees demonstrate poor form and technique during their laps, Twilight suggests that Rainbow give them advice, but Rainbow states she doesn't want to mess with their confidence. Luckily, the academy's trials week has a classroom portion, and Twilight sees this as an opportunity to both teach the trainees and observe their relationships.   In the academy classroom, Twilight and Rainbow introduce themselves to the trainees. Among them are two particular trainees: an overconfident stallion named   and his timid wingpony/best friend  . The two have always flown together, but Rainbow points out that part of the trainees' final evaluations is a solo flight trial. Vapor Trail is intimidated by this, but Sky Stinger is certain that he'll pass.  After class, Sky Stinger approaches Twilight and Rainbow and admits, although he is sure of his own flying skills, he worries about Vapor Trail's chances. With the freestyle training portion of the academy trials about to start, Twilight and Rainbow offer to observe their team flying.   In their observations of Sky and Vapor, Twilight and Rainbow discover that Vapor is using her wings to boost Sky's flight power, meaning he's not as great a flyer as he thinks. At the same time, Vapor is so focused on making Sky look good, she disregards her own flying. As a result, the two are unintentionally holding each other back from succeeding. Twilight realizes this is the friendship problem that they've been summoned to solve. However, while Twilight thinks they should tell Sky and Vapor what they are doing, Rainbow Dash believes telling them could harm their performance in the academy trials. In the academy locker rooms, Twilight and Rainbow speak with Vapor Trail alone and reveal they know she's been supporting Sky Stinger. Vapor Trail feigns ignorance, but they inform her that her secret could negatively affect Sky's evaluation during the solo trials. When asked why she supports Sky the way she does, Vapor explains that Sky grew up with a lot of brothers and sisters and often struggled to get attention from his parents. Meanwhile, Vapor grew up as an only child and received too much attention from her parents.   When Sky struggled to perform aerial tricks for his parents, Vapor secretly gave him a boost with her wings and offered him praise, and the two became friends. Since then, the two have always flown together, with Vapor boosting Sky's flying, but Sky remained ignorant of Vapor's actions. Twilight and Rainbow explain that Vapor and Sky need to improve their skills as individuals or else they won't be able to get into the academy. Vapor agrees but wants to keep Sky in the dark about what she's been doing so his confidence isn't damaged.   Rainbow Dash helps Vapor Trail improve her aerobatic tricks, and Twilight personally tutors Sky Stinger in strengthening his wingpower. Unfortunately, only Vapor shows a marked improvement; Sky under-performs at every aspect of Twilight's training. Despite this, Sky remains certain that he'll easily get into the academy and become a Wonderbolt. Unable to keep her secret any longer, Vapor admits to having helped Sky fly the whole time. When Sky fails to do an aerial trick on his own, he becomes bitter and takes it out on Vapor, accusing her of trying to humiliate him. Sky flies off in anger, wondering why he was ever friends with Vapor in the first place.   Later, during the Dizzitron trials, Sky Stinger refuses to acknowledge Vapor Trail, much to her heartbreak. Twilight believes this could've been avoided if they had just done things Rainbow Dash's way, but Rainbow realizes that Twilight's solution was better after observing Sky's earlier lack of effort. As a result of Sky and Vapor's falling-out, Sky performs terribly in his trial evaluations. Spitfire is irritated to see one of her most promising trainees suddenly fail, but Rainbow vows to fix things.   Some time later, Twilight approaches the downtrodden Sky Stinger and explains to him that she was once just as bad at friendship as he is at performing tricks. However, she improved over time with practice and the help of her friends. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash goes to Vapor Trail and tells her that she would be an amazing flyer if she came out from under Sky Stinger's shadow. Having had no interest in being a Wonderbolt before, Vapor Trail admits that she had fun practicing tricks with Rainbow earlier and decides this is indeed what she wants for herself. At Twilight and Rainbow's encouragement, Sky Stinger and Vapor Trail reconcile their differences and misunderstandings. Sky makes more of an effort to improve his own flying skills, and he gives Vapor advice on her aerobatic feats.   When the day arrives for the trainees' solo trials, Sky Stinger and Vapor Trail each give impressive performances, much to the amazement of their fellow trainees. As a result, they are accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy with flying colors. Sky Stinger acknowledges that, even though Vapor Trail is a better flyer than him, she can be his wingpony anytime. As they fly off together, Twilight and Rainbow's cutie marks start to glow, meaning their friendship mission is a success.   With their friendship mission complete, Twilight and Rainbow Dash return home to Ponyville. But before Rainbow can enjoy spending time with her friends,   appears on Twilight's castle doorstep and informs Rainbow of a ""Wonderbolt emergency"" at the academy that requires her immediate attention.

As Twilight expresses how proud she is to call Starlight her pupil, Spike looks out the castle window and sees something approaching from the sky. Moments later, mailpony   comes crashing in. She delivers a letter to Starlight Glimmer from  . Twilight and Spike believe the town is in danger or upset with Starlight, but Starlight says it is much worse:    The next day, Starlight travels to her old village, where  ,  ,  ,  , and the other villagers have decorated for the Sunset Festival. When Starlight greets them, they cruelly turn her away and tear up her festival invitation. As the villagers start to laugh at her, Starlight shuts her eyes. When she reopens them, day has turned to night, and everyone around her has vanished. Just then,   appears through the fog and reveals that Starlight is only having a dream. Realizing she is more nervous about the festival than she thought, Starlight asks Luna what she should do. Luna tells Starlight that the Mane Six have helped her time and time again and suggests that she share her concerns with them.   The next morning, the Mane Six and Spike are gathered in the castle throne room, and Starlight confides in them her worries about going to the Sunset Festival, questioning how much they have truly forgiven her and how much she has really changed. The ponies assure Starlight that she has changed for the better and that she would not have been invited to the Sunset Festival if the villagers did not believe the same. Twilight suggests that Starlight bring a friend along to help make things easier. Though Twilight subtly hints that Starlight bring her along, Starlight instead chooses to bring along  , much to Trixie's delight and Twilight's disappointment.    Some time later, Starlight and Trixie arrive on the outskirts of Starlight's old village. Starlight hopes to enjoy the festival without attracting too much attention, and Trixie promises to drag her out of there if she gets too uncomfortable. As they enter the town, the villagers greet Starlight much more positively than they did in her nightmare. However, they quickly overwhelm her with questions about where she is living and how long she will be staying. Surrounded by ponies on all sides, the panicked Starlight pushes them away with a magical force field and cowers to the ground in fear. Recognizing her friend's discomfort, Trixie spirits them away from the town with a smoke bomb. As they return to  , Starlight feels ashamed about how she left, but Trixie tells her that everyone makes mistakes—even Trixie herself.    Back in Ponyville, Starlight Glimmer meets up with some of her friends, but she notices them acting strangely:   does not know Starlight's name or where she went,   and   laugh at her misfortune, and   and   whisper to the others in secret. When she goes to speak to Twilight about it at the castle, Spike almost refuses her entry, and when she explains to Twilight what happened at the village, Twilight advises her to ""cut her losses"" and never go back there. Starlight is considerably surprised to hear such advice from the princess of friendship. That night, Starlight Glimmer has another dream about her old village. The villagers she encounters all ignore her, and Twilight appears with her friends to harshly scold Starlight for disobeying her orders. As Starlight senses there is something wrong, the Mane Six vanish into thin air. Princess Luna appears out of the moon, but something appears to hold her back. She informs Starlight Glimmer that the   have returned and captured her and  . She tells Starlight to find help but to also be careful of who she trusts. As Luna is detained by the changelings, Starlight is forcibly awakened from her dream.   Starlight sneaks out of the castle and goes to wake up Trixie in her nearby cart.

As before, Starlight's friends look to her for guidance, despite her discomfort being in a leadership role. Hesitantly, she makes a plan for them to infiltrate the hive, destroy the throne, and regain their magic. On their way to the hive, Discord and Trixie squabble. Starlight suggests they come up with a way to identify each other in case they get separated, like a secret code. After Discord trips over a rock, Trixie comes up with the code phrase ""klutzy draconequus"", much to Discord's chagrin.    Inside the hive, Starlight, Discord, and Trixie find the inner layout to have a constantly shifting geography; chamber doorways are always opening and closing in random locations, and only changelings are able to navigate it. As Starlight and her friends traverse the inner workings of the hive, Starlight is unsure how they will even destroy the throne when they find it, and Discord and Trixie continue to argue. Starlight is barely able to keep it together being thrust into her role as leader, and the situation is made worse when they become lost in the hive in spite of Thorax's navigation. As Trixie gives up hope, she asks Thorax about changelings' feeding habits, and Thorax explains that he hasn't been hungry since meeting  , despite the fact that changelings are always hungry. He also explains that, since becoming friends with the  , he has disregarded his usual feeding habits, and his wings became embedded with crystal.   When Discord loudly announces his intention to save Fluttershy, he attracts the attention of a changeling patrol. Starlight Glimmer comes up with the idea of Thorax disguising himself as Trixie and evading the changelings with smoke bombs. After giving them the slip, Starlight expands her plan further by following some of the changelings to Chrysalis' throne room.  Starlight and her friends follow the changelings to Chrysalis' inner sanctum, but with the hive now on high alert, the entrance is heavily guarded. Trixie is out of smoke bombs, so Discord distracts the changeling guards with stand-up comedy. The changelings chase after him, allowing Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax to enter the inner sanctum.   Discord eventually eludes the changelings in a cocoon nursery, and he reunites with Fluttershy, sobbing with her tail caught under a rock. Fluttershy is overjoyed to see Discord, but Discord immediately recognizes this to be a trap. As Fluttershy continues to cry, numerous crying Fluttershy duplicates appear, and Discord is left wondering if one of them is the real Fluttershy. Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax wait for Discord to return, but Trixie believes he might have been captured, and Thorax suggests they move on toward the throne room. Just then, Discord appears to regroup with his friends and says he learned from the changelings where the throne room is. However, he doesn't recognize their ""klutzy draconequus"" code phrase, and the others immediately realize he's a changeling.   As ""Discord"" leads his friends down the left path at a fork in the road, Thorax warns that he's leading them into an ambush. Trixie volunteers to distract the changeling while Starlight and Thorax find the throne, but Starlight is unsure of moving on without her best friend. Trixie assures Starlight that, even without magic, she has been an excellent leader thus far. After Trixie distracts ""Discord"" with a magic trick that binds their wrists together, Starlight and Thorax escape, leaving Trixie to be captured by the waiting swarm.  As Starlight and Thorax continue running from the changelings, they split up in order to avoid capture. Eventually, Starlight finds her way into Chrysalis' throne room and discovers the throne – as well as all of her friends trapped in cocoons on the ceiling. Unfortunately, Chrysalis had been waiting for Starlight to arrive, and the changelings come out of hiding to restrain her.   Chrysalis brags that she thought so little of Starlight that she didn't bother replacing her with one of her changeling drones. With all of the most important and powerful ponies in   captured, Chrysalis is certain of her victory. However, Starlight reminds her of Thorax, and Chrysalis angrily tells her not to mention the ""traitor"". As Chrysalis threatens to teach Thorax a lesson for betraying the hive, Starlight's eyes glimmer with a blue light, and Chrysalis realizes that Thorax has been in front of her the whole time. Meanwhile, Starlight herself attempts to break the throne, but she is caught in the act and forced to take shelter from Chrysalis' attacks inside the hollow throne. Despite this development, Chrysalis remarks that everything has gone according to her plan to harvest all the love in Equestria and feed her hive for generations.    Remembering Thorax's crystallized wings and satisfied hunger, Starlight proposes to Chrysalis that she and her changelings don't have to take others' love by force. Chrysalis dismisses this notion, stating that changeling hunger can never be satisfied. Starlight explains that ever since Thorax made friends and started sharing love, he hasn't needed to feed as often as changelings usually do. Starlight's words start to reach the changeling drones, but Chrysalis is still dismissive of the claims of a ""mewling grub"". Despite her powerlessness, Starlight confronts Chrysalis directly, understanding what it's like to lead through fear and intimidation.   Ignoring Starlight's words, Chrysalis starts to drain the love that Thorax gained from the Crystal Ponies. Thorax is unable to hold onto the love inside him, so Starlight tells him to share it with Chrysalis willingly. This creates a tremendous burst of light that blows Chrysalis away and transforms Thorax into a new form of changeling: he is now taller with a green coat, orange pincers, and luminescent wings, and the holes in his hooves have been healed. The other changelings follow Thorax's example of sharing love and take on similar, colorful forms. The resulting magical energy causes Chrysalis' throne to explode, and the ponies that the changelings captured are all freed. As   commends Starlight on her accomplishment, Chrysalis emerges from the rubble. Starlight Glimmer stands before her again, telling her that she can be a leader her subjects deserve, and offers her hoof in friendship. However, Chrysalis rejects Starlight's offering and swears absolute revenge upon her before flying away.   With Chrysalis' abandonment of her kingdom, Thorax is declared the changelings' new ruler, and   looks forward to improving relationship between ponies and changelings. Discord proposes a tea celebration at  , but Starlight Glimmer has a better idea.   Starlight returns to  , and   and   are surprised to see her again after the way she left just recently. Starlight expresses how much she has changed since she first founded the village and how comfortable she is being a more positive and listening leader. With that in mind, she offers to help oversee the remainder of the Sunset Festival and asks to allow her other friends to join, to which the villagers happily agree. As the ponies join in the festival, Discord and Trixie reconcile after their earlier arguing, and Discord even offers to incorporate some of his chaos powers into her magic act.  Taking Trixie at her literal word, Discord conjures up a pair of untamed flying pigs, and he and Trixie go flying down the street, much to the confusion of the Mane Six and Spike.      "

During the reception party, while Starlight and Trixie mingle with their friends, Discord asks Twilight what her plans are for her student. Twilight says she has three more years of   planned out, but Discord laughs it off, saying Starlight has progressed beyond needing friendship lessons. Due to Discord's persistent needling on the subject, Twilight gets very nervous about her plans for Starlight, to the point of retreating to her library. Realizing that Starlight has mastered nearly every lesson that Twilight mapped out for her, Twilight turns to her own mentor   for advice. In the throne room, Twilight explains her dilemma to Celestia and comes to realize that, just as Celestia had sent Twilight away to   to learn about friendship, she must now send Starlight away. Celestia sympathizes with Twilight and tells her no matter how difficult or painful her decision, she must decide for herself what's right.    As Discord informs the rest of the Mane Six about Twilight's upcoming decision, Twilight tries to decide where to send Starlight to further her friendship studies through a series of magical simulations. In the first simulation, she considers sending Starlight to the   to help them adjust to their new way of life.

After watching all of Twilight's simulations and listening to all of her worries, Celestia starts to laugh. She reveals that, when they were teacher and student, Celestia had the same fears about Twilight that Twilight now has about Starlight. When Twilight was a filly, she demonstrated great academic aptitude but always kept herself isolated from other ponies. Eventually, Celestia decided the best thing was to send Twilight to Ponyville, but she kept coming up with excuses to not send her away. She realized it was because she didn't want Twilight to go and that once she made friends, she wouldn't need her teacher anymore. Twilight conveys to Celestia that she will always need her, and Celestia assures her that Starlight feels the same way.  Twilight returns to the party in the castle dining hall, and the ponies eagerly await her announcement. Twilight officially recognizes Starlight's completed lessons and many accomplishments and says she has nothing left to teach her. With this, she announces that today is her pupil's graduation day, and the ponies cheer for Starlight Glimmer.   Before Starlight makes plans with her friends to celebrate her graduation, she pulls Twilight aside to discuss what this means in more detail. While Twilight is very proud of her student and assures her that she's ready, Starlight reveals that she isn't ready to leave yet. This comes as a great relief to Twilight, and she presents her with her graduation gift: a decorative wall mirror with photographs of her friends. Starlight tearfully thanks Twilight for the gift, and Twilight says no matter what comes next, she will always be there for her.

When Starlight vents her frustration at her, Trixie offers a simple bag of pretzels as a substitute.

Later, when Fluttershy checks on the expert ponies' progress, she discovers that they have gone against her wishes and started building the animal sanctuary according to their own respective expertise. As a result, the front door is too small for larger animals to fit through, Dandy's curtains block out the sunlight, and Wrangler's cages are too confining.

After Rarity's overeager entrance, Sweetie Belle can't bring herself to turn her away in favor of helping Zipporwhill, but   and   encourage Sweetie to spend the day with her sister while they help Zipporwhill by themselves.   In their first activity together, Rarity takes Sweetie Belle to see a puppet show put on by   the puppeteer. Rarity is certain that Sweetie would enjoy it as much as she used to, but Sweetie's interest in the puppet show is mild. Next, Rarity takes Sweetie Belle to her old favorite ice cream shop, where she has even brought the shop's original owner out of retirement to make Sweetie's favorite dessert. While Sweetie's tastes have changed since she was younger, she indulges her sister's efforts so as not to disappoint her. Meanwhile, Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Zipporwhill attempt to entice Zipporwhill's dog Ripley with puppy toys, but the grown dog looks uninterested.   Later, Rarity takes Sweetie Belle to where balloon artist   is making balloon animals, unaware that Sweetie Belle is uninterested in the childish activities. When Sweetie sees the other Crusaders and Zipporwhill nearby, she confides in her friends that she doesn't feel like Rarity knows her anymore. Likewise, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo are having little progress in helping Zipporwhill.   In their next sister activity, Rarity and Sweetie Belle have a photoshoot in childish costumes. When Rarity notices Sweetie Belle frowning in every photo, Rarity suggests a reshoot, but Sweetie Belle refuses. She finally confesses to Rarity that she's not having fun and that she's outgrown the activities they have been doing. When Rarity insists that Sweetie Belle loves those activities, Sweetie realizes Rarity doesn't know her at all and runs off. At the same time, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo's lack of progress with Ripley causes Zipporwhill to doubt her cutie mark, and she comes to the conclusion that her puppy doesn't love her anymore. Rarity considers Sweetie Belle ungrateful and unappreciative for the day she had planned for the two of them, and she follows her sister to lecture her. Meanwhile, Sweetie Belle finds Zipporwhill sulking by herself and crying over her seemingly unfriendly puppy. When Sweetie Belle sees Ripley's old puppy toys, she comes up with an idea. They regroup with Apple Bloom and Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle explains to Zipporwhill that Ripley is no longer a little puppy—he's a full-grown dog—and little puppy toys no longer interest him. She tells Zipporwhill to treat Ripley like the dog he's grown into and find new things to do together with him.   Having overheard Sweetie Belle's lesson, Rarity enters and apologizes for treating her like a little filly. She explains to Sweetie Belle that she loved doing their earlier activities when she was younger and was only trying to recapture that feeling. Sweetie Belle shares her sister's sentiment, and they agree to find new things to do together. As Rarity and Sweetie reconcile, Zipporwhill discovers that Ripley likes to play fetch, and the two successfully reconnect.   Rarity tells Sweetie Belle how proud she is of the pony she has become, and Sweetie Belle is happy that no matter what happens, she'll always be Rarity's little sister. With the little time she has left before returning to Canterlot, Rarity asks Sweetie Belle what she wants to do, and the two share large twin sundaes at the ice cream shop. The episode ends with Rarity and Sweetie Belle smiling for a warm sister photo.      "

Upon arriving in Cloudsdale, Scootaloo ends up at the home of Rainbow Dash's parents,  , much to her extreme excitement. After her initial starstruck awe, Scootaloo explains to Bow and Windy that she's doing a school report about their daughter and putting together a scrapbook dedicated to her. Bow and Windy, the incredibly proud parents they are, give Scootaloo a tour of their house and show her Rainbow's bedroom and vast collection of medals and trophies.   When Scootaloo asks where Rainbow's ""Wonderbolt stuff"" is, Bow and Windy think she's referring to her collection of   memorabilia. However, Scootaloo actually refers to mementos from her time as a   cadet and eventually a full-fledged Wonderbolt, drawing much confusion from the two parents.  At the Wonderbolt Academy, Rainbow Dash practices a flying routine with the Wonderbolts when Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles' loud cheering suddenly disrupts them. After Scootaloo informed them that their daughter is a Wonderbolt, the already proud parents are even prouder. They smother Rainbow with pride and affection and introduce themselves to   and the other Wonderbolts. Rainbow chews Scootaloo out about telling her parents that she's a Wonderbolt without her permission, saying that while she loves her parents dearly, they can be very embarrassing.  During the next Wonderbolts show, Scootaloo recounts to Bow and Windy their daughter's journey to becoming a Wonderbolt, from her   to   to her   with deceitful veteran   and her  . As the Wonderbolts perform, Bow and Windy get considerably carried away in showing their daughter support, cheering boisterously and setting off fireworks.

When Rainbow's parents go as far as cheering for her in the Wonderbolts locker room, she finally snaps and angrily says their support is too much for her to bear. She tells them their over-passionate cheering is why she didn't tell them she was a Wonderbolt in the first place, and she asks them to leave. Saddened by their daughter's outburst, Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles leave the locker room in tears. Scootaloo, shocked by Rainbow's cruel dismissal of her supportive parents, decides to write her school report about someone else.   Rainbow Dash catches up with Scootaloo to offer an explanation for why she snapped at her parents. She reveals that, when she was a little filly, she wasn't always a fast flyer, and the only thing she could win in competitive races was participation awards. However, her parents cheered for her just as loudly and embarrassingly as in the present day, despite her never winning any races. Over time, she started to win races and place higher in competitions, but her parents' overzealous support alienated the other foals. Scootaloo expresses some jealousy that Rainbow Dash has parents as supportive as they are. She explains further that because of their lifelong support, Rainbow was given the confidence she needed to become a better flyer. Realizing she had taken her parents for granted, Rainbow feels guilty for yelling at them and resolves to fix her mistake.   A short while later, Scootaloo takes Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles to a special Wonderbolts performance, in which Rainbow apologizes for upsetting them and thanks them for helping her become the pony she is today.

Sugar Belle expresses to Big Mac how excited she is to bake apple-flavored treats but needing more shelf space in her bakery to display them. When the Crusaders see how Big Mac acts toward Sugar Belle, they realize he has a crush on her.   Big Mac is nervous about telling Sugar Belle how he feels, but the Crusaders are sure she feels the same way about him because she orders so many apples just to see him. With the Crusaders' encouragement, Big Mac approaches Sugar Belle with a flower. However, before he can say anything, he gets pushed out of the way by a smooth-tongued stallion named   who also has affection for Sugar Belle.

First, in their ""rescuing a damsel in distress"" plan, the Crusaders create a scenario in which Big Mac comes to Sugar Belle's rescue when she's in trouble. While in disguise, Scootaloo steals Sugar Belle's saddlebag, and Big Mac tries to stop her.

"Honest Apple","Kevin Lappin","2017-06-03","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Honest_Apple"," is the ninth   of   of   and the one hundred and fifty-second overall. When   asks   to be a judge in a fashion show, Applejack learns that an opinion, however honest, can still be hurtful.   This episode aired on Canada's Treehouse TV channel on May 14, 2017, twenty days ahead of its scheduled premiere on Discovery Family.     The episode begins with  —with  's assistance—putting up flyers for an upcoming fashion contest that she is hosting at  . While putting up flyers, she runs into   and explains that the winner of the contest will have their designs put on display at the boutique. To serve as the contest's judges, Rarity has enlisted  ,  , and a surprise guest:   overhears this while walking past, and she is confused as to why Rarity would select her to be a judge in a fashion contest. Rarity explains that, while Hoity Toity is an expert at fashion and Photo Finish has an artistic eye, neither of them share Applejack's practicality and honesty. Applejack is still unsure about being a judge, however, so she agrees to think it over. While she returns to  , Rarity and Spike continue putting up flyers.   At Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack confides in   and   about her uncertainties in being a fashion judge, but she demonstrates her practicality during apple-bucking by helping Apple Bloom with a new look she's trying out. Realizing the fashion community could benefit from her sensible outlook, Applejack returns to Rarity and agrees to be a contest judge. Just then, Photo Finish and Hoity Toity arrive, and Applejack demonstrates her ability as an honest and practical judge for them by bluntly criticizing photos from  's recent fashion debut.   In the boutique sewing room, Rarity, Hoity Toity, Photo Finish, and Applejack meet the three ponies taking part in Rarity's contest: a flighty   mare with a Valley girl accent named  , an   stallion with a taste for avant-garde named  , and a goth   mare named  . For the contest, Lily Lace intends to present designs inspired by bird songs, Starstreak looks to more cutting-edge and ""futuristic"" designs, and Inky Rose's designs incorporate mostly black and dark colors. Hoity Toity and Photo Finish approve of the designers' inspirations, but Applejack's reactions are mainly those of criticism, questioning the functionality of the designers' clothes. Both the designers and the other judges are put off by Applejack's words, but Rarity assures Applejack that her practicality is exactly what the contest needs. However, Applejack's blunt critiquing wears on the contestants' patience as the day goes on. Before she upsets the designers and other judges too much, Rarity cuts the day short for the contestants to get ready for the public showing of their designs the next day. While Applejack is pleased by the day's progress, Rarity worries that Applejack's candid opinions about fashion will jeopardize the contest results.    The next day, Rarity and the contest judges oversee the final adjustments of the contestants' designs before their evening debut. Like the day before, Photo Finish and Hoity Toity are mostly receptive to the contestants' work, but Applejack once again favors function over fashion, criticizing their designs until they meet her satisfaction. When Photo Finish and Hoity Toity get into an argument over which belt to accessorize Starstreak's designs with (despite both belts appearing to be completely identical), Applejack vents her frustration and admits she finds all fashion ridiculous. Feeling insulted, Photo Finish, Hoity Toity, and the contest designers leave, and Rarity follows them in tears.   With her contest now ruined, Rarity tells the construction ponies assembling the runway to stop building, placing blame for this fiasco on Applejack. When Applejack argues she was just being honest like Rarity wanted, Rarity sets out to prove that some honesty can be hurtful. She takes Applejack to the home of  , who bluntly reveals that she hates apples. This greatly offends Applejack, but Rarity points out that it's just Strawberry's ""honest opinion"". Applejack realizes that Strawberry's harsh opinions about apples mirror her own opinions about the contest designers' hard work, and she resolves to fix the mess she made.   Before Photo Finish, Hoity Toity, and the contest designers leave  , Applejack brings them back to Carousel Boutique—mainly by tying them up and hijacking their modes of  —and apologizes to them for being unintentionally hurtful with her honesty. She also admits that, while she still doesn't fully understand fashion, she can appreciate the passion and hard work they put into it. Applejack asks them to finish the contest, and the designers and judges agree.  Applejack helps the construction ponies rebuild the contest runway and assists the contest designers finish their designs. When Rarity returns to the boutique—after Pinkie Pie kept her distracted for an hour—Applejack apologizes for nearly ruining the contest, and Rarity thanks her for her efforts. With that, the designers finally reveal their designs to the public. During the vote for the contest winner, Rarity votes for Lily Lace, Hoity Toity votes for Inky Rose, and Photo Finish votes for Starstreak. Applejack, unable to decide on a winner, votes for all three, resulting in a three-way tie.   Some time later, Applejack and Rarity discuss how to put the contest designers' designs on display in the boutique. When they pass one of Rarity's new dresses on a mannequin, Applejack tries to restrain her honesty so Rarity doesn't get upset. However, even Rarity admits that the dress is absolutely awful, and the two friends share a laugh.      "

The episode begins at the  , where the   is summoning   to  , to Starlight's delight and  's complete shock. Even more surprising is that the Map is summoning Starlight alone instead of two ponies as it had previously done. Twilight believes the friendship problem Starlight is being called to solve is minor, but   suggests the possibility of it being between the royal sisters   and  . At Canterlot Castle, Starlight meets with Celestia and Luna; while Celestia welcomes Starlight happily, Luna appears bitter about something.    In Starlight Glimmer's castle suite, Twilight appears before her in the form of a ballerina music box and asks about the situation. Starlight explains that the friendship problem is indeed between Celestia and Luna and that there is an unspoken tension between them. Unable to help Starlight due to the Cutie Map not summoning her, Twilight offers her consultation if she needs it. The next morning, Starlight joins Celestia for a pancake breakfast in the castle dining hall. However, a sleepy and irritable Luna enters to pick up a pineapple and quickly excuses herself—behavior which, according to Celestia, she exhibits every morning. Later that evening, Starlight joins Luna as she puts up lavender flowers to help ponies in the castle sleep soundly. But as Celestia walks past laughing with dignitaries, Luna feels her sister is unappreciative of her efforts.   Starlight explains the situation to Twilight and says she plans to confront the princesses directly about her lack of communication. Twilight warns Starlight, however, that the last time the sisters fought, Luna turned into   and Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years.  The following morning, Starlight and Celestia share a pancake breakfast again, and like the previous morning, Luna quickly enters only for food and attempts to leave. This time, Starlight confronts the two sisters about their respective lack of appreciation for the other's efforts. Celestia and Luna try to talk about their problem, but it quickly turns into an argument over whose royal duties are more difficult.   In an effort to stop their arguing, Starlight Glimmer uses her magic to switch their   for twenty-four hours. The princesses are angered at first, but Starlight sees this as an opportunity for them to trade places and learn to appreciate the burden of each other's daily duties. Begrudgingly, Celestia and Luna agree. When Starlight informs Twilight of this development, she hyperventilates.    Later that day, Luna sees to Celestia's checklist of royal duties, many of which involve public appearances and smiling uncomfortably to her subjects. During a photo-op at a   fundraiser, the photographer takes Luna's picture right when her cheeks are so sore that she stops smiling. This causes her to get discredited in the newspaper and the fundraiser to fail. After meeting with some delegates and failing to dispel rumors of   occupying the  , Luna starts to understand Celestia's daily routine of dealing with many ponies at once. After addressing a three-hour-long dispute between the mayors of   and  , an exhausted Luna turns in for the day.  That night, after everyone in Equestria has gone to sleep, Celestia sees to Luna's royal duties; the solitude of being the only pony awake causes her to start talking to herself. With Luna's magic, Celestia travels to the dreamscape to observe ponies' dreams and relieve them of their nightmares. She finds Starlight Glimmer having a nightmare, doubting her own decision to switch Celestia and Luna's cutie marks and causing them to drift even further apart. She fears her inability to solve their friendship problem will cause Nightmare Moon to return, and Nightmare Moon herself suddenly appears. As Princess Celestia protects Starlight Glimmer from Nightmare Moon, an evil and fiery alter ego of Celestia also appears: Daybreaker.    Daybreaker tries to make Celestia doubt her relationship with Luna, and she fights against Nightmare Moon. With Celestia and Starlight caught in the middle, Starlight fears she has doomed Equestria. Using the power of the dream world, Celestia observes Luna's nightmare, in which she fears causing further sadness to the school foals. Celestia appears to pull Luna out of her nightmare and into Starlight's, where Luna witnesses the struggle between Nightmare Moon and Daybreaker. As Starlight continues to despair, Luna tells Celestia that it is up to her alone to stop the nightmare. Celestia doubts herself, admitting that Luna's responsibility and burden are much harder than her own. Luna admits the same about Celestia's responsibilities and provides her support. With her sister's faith and trust, Celestia intervenes in Nightmare Moon and Daybreaker's conflict, eventually succeeding in dispelling the nightmare visions.    The next morning, Luna offers her own pancake breakfast to Celestia—albeit poorly made—and the two sisters reconcile over their previous disagreements with a better appreciation of each other's duties. As Starlight Glimmer joins them, they commend her for having the boldness to do what she did. The effects of the cutie mark switching spell wear off, returning Celestia and Luna's cutie marks to normal, and Starlight's own cutie mark starts to glow, signifying a successful Cutie Map mission. Suddenly, a hyperactive Twilight appears to congratulate Starlight and asks for a detailed summary of events. Luna informs Celestia about the School for Gifted Unicorns and timberwolf-related incidents from the day before and quickly leaves for bed before Celestia can react.      "
"Not Asking for Trouble","May Chan","2017-06-17","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Not_Asking_for_Trouble"," is the eleventh   of   of   and the one hundred and fifty-fourth overall. It marks season seven's midseason finale. In this episode, an avalanche falls on  , and   tries to convince   and the proud yaks to ask the   for help.  This episode aired on Canada's Treehouse TV channel on May 21, 2017, twenty-seven days ahead of its scheduled premiere on Discovery Family.     The episode begins with   hopping excitedly to the   to share big news with her friends;   and the   of   have invited her to their holiday celebration of Yickslurbertfest. The rest of the Mane Six approve of Pinkie's continued relations with the yaks, and   even appoints her as the official friendship ambassador to Yakyakistan. After a considerably long ride in the  , Pinkie Pie and   arrive at the small village of Yakyakistan, where they are warmly greeted by Prince Rutherford. Pinkie finds the yaks stomping logs and other objects to pieces and fears that Yickslurbertfest has been cancelled, but Rutherford explains that stomping is a traditional part of the Yickslurbertfest holiday. After Rutherford pulls a small prank on Pinkie, she joins in the Yakyakistani traditions.    A short while later, Rutherford gives Pinkie Pie a tour of Yakyakistan and shows her the village's many features and customs. These include a ceremonial fire pit around which the yaks sit and tell stories and various mud huts specifically used for eating, sleeping, and listening to music. By the end of the day, Pinkie has absorbed so much yak culture that she adopts their unique form of speech and Rutherford considers her an honorary yak. During the next Yickslurbertfest session of stomping, Pinkie Pie and the yaks stomp so loudly and forcefully that they accidentally trigger an avalanche; snow from the nearby mountain falls and covers the entire village. Prince Rutherford assures Pinkie that this happens during every Yickslurbertfest and that the tenacious yaks will have the snow removed shortly. However, despite Pinkie and the yaks' efforts, there is too much snow for them to dig through, and their forceful digging only causes more snow to fall from the mountain.   Pinkie Pie offers to return to   and get help from her friends, but the proud Rutherford and his subjects refuse to accept help from ponies. Rutherford suggests simply waiting for the snow to melt, and he and his subjects resort to eating and sleeping on snow to survive. Pinkie goes along with Rutherford's judgment in order to maintain her position as friendship ambassador.   Over the course of the following day, Pinkie Pie notices the yaks freezing from sleeping on the snow and eating snow-made foods. The younger yaks complain about their growing hunger but remain quiet so as not to defy their prince. Thus, Pinkie vows to convince Rutherford that it's okay to ask for help. Pinkie Pie gathers the yaks around the new ceremonial fire pit to tell a story. Her story involves a situation very similar to that of Yakyakistan's—substituting the yaks for goats, the snow for desert sand, and the ponies for cows—and tells of how the goats reached out to the cows for help in their time of need. Unfortunately, Rutherford fails to absorb the lesson of Pinkie's story.   Pinkie then tries using reverse psychology to get Rutherford to invite the rest of her friends to enjoy the snow-covered Yakyakistan. However, Rutherford responds with a questionable tale about his childhood and reaffirms that yaks don't ask for help from others. When Pinkie starts to get desperate, Rutherford decides that she doesn't truly understand yak culture, and he revokes her honorary yak title. Frustrated by the prince's stubbornness, Pinkie Pie leaves Yakyakistan.   As Pinkie Pie returns to Ponyville, Prince Rutherford and the yaks consign themselves to their new snow-filled lifestyle—despite growing unrest among the yaks toward their prince's leadership. Meanwhile, at the Castle of Friendship in Ponyville, Pinkie Pie explains the yaks' situation to her friends and decides to help Yakyakistan anyway.   offers to bring the yaks apples to eat and   offers fabrics to keep them warm, but Pinkie insists that, because the yaks are too proud to ask for help, the ponies must help them covertly. The Mane Six return to Yakyakistan after dark and sneak into the village. As the yaks sleep, the ponies remove most of the snow, clear the storm clouds, restore their crops and hay beds, and bake fresh Yakyakistan cakes. When the yaks wake up the next morning, they are surprised to find their village back to normal. The yaks' faith in Rutherford is restored, but Rutherford notices the ponies just as they are leaving.   When Rutherford confronts Pinkie Pie outside the village gates, she fears his angry retribution, but he is instead grateful that Pinkie had the sensitivity to help his village without making them ask. Because she truly does understand yak culture, Rutherford declares her an honorary yak again and gives her a set of fake yak horns.      "

The episode begins at  's   during Fluttershy and  's weekly tea party, with Discord supplying his usual signature brand of chaos to the mix. When Fluttershy mentions having to restock on sugarcubes, Discord realizes how much effort she puts into organizing their weekly get-togethers. Feeling like he has taken advantage of Fluttershy's hospitality enough, Discord offers to throw their next tea party in his home realm of   the very next day. Fluttershy is not only looking forward to Discord's tea party but also to visiting his home for the first time, and Discord, realizing he has never hosted a party before, leaves to make appropriate preparations. In  , he has a conversation with a duplicate of himself about how to put together the best tea party that Fluttershy has ever had.    Discord goes to Fluttershy's usual tea shop and, upon seeing the boring teas that the shopkeeper is selling, buys some bags of ginseng and uses his magic to make them sing. At a china shop, he buys a tea set for two and uses his magic to make the teapot sprout wings. Finally, at a party store, he buys a sneezing piñata and glowing, flying napkins. During his party shopping, Discord runs into   and asks for her advice on how to make the ideal tea party for Fluttershy. Pinkie tells him to simply make Fluttershy feel comfortable. Upon returning to his home in Chaosville, Discord realizes that the chaos around his house would make Fluttershy  . With the help of several duplicates of himself, Discord sets out to create an environment that Fluttershy would like. First, he gets rid of all the new party supplies that he bought in Ponyville. Next, he gets rid of the various chaotic elements already in his house, such as chairs that hang from the ceiling and staircases that don't lead anywhere.   After placing more normal-looking household decor, Discord finally gives himself a new, normal look. With his own duplicates, Discord also practices more conventional party conversation.   When the time for their scheduled tea party arrives, Discord transports Fluttershy to his realm, and Fluttershy is excited to finally see where he lives. However, she is surprised by how normal Discord and everything around him looks. Without the usual chaos that Fluttershy has come to expect from Discord, she appears considerably disappointed. She asks Discord about the drastic changes he has made to himself, but Discord assures her that he feels perfectly normal. When Discord picks up the tea kettle, however, it suddenly phases through his hand and falls on the floor. Much to Fluttershy's shock, he is starting to fade out of existence. Each time Discord exhibits ""normal"" behavior, he fades away even further, and Fluttershy realizes that his new, non-chaotic persona is slowly destroying him. Unfortunately, Discord is unfazed by this development and continues to act normal, despite the effect it is having on him.   In an effort to stop Discord from fading, Fluttershy begs him to do something chaotic, but his ghostlike appearance prevents him from doing so. Therefore, Fluttershy starts causing her own chaos around Discord's house—knocking over teacups, talking to her own reflections, disorganizing the furniture, and nailing chairs to the ceiling. This inspires Discord's old chaotic self, and he starts to recorporealize. Once he's back to physical form, he joins in the fun and brings back the singing ginseng tea bags and floating furniture.   When Discord mentions that his style of party throwing is the complete opposite of Fluttershy's, Fluttershy says she never expected him to throw a party like her because of how different they are. Discord fears driving Fluttershy away   of their differences—because their friendship doesn't make sense. But Fluttershy reveals that he's introduced her to so many things since they became friends and that she likes him   of their differences.  With Discord back to his old self, he throws a proper Chaosville tea party for himself and Fluttershy, replete with sneezing piñatas, singing tea bags, and upside-down sandwich butterfly-catching games.

As the ponies finish setting up camp, however, they are suddenly surrounded by a large swarm of  —spiders with wings. They take shelter from the swarm's bites and webs in a nearby cave. Applejack explains that the typically  -indigenous Fly-ders were probably attracted by the camp food and that they'll have to wait until the swarm moves on, much to Apple Bloom's disappointment. After making a campfire, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash offer to tell the fillies stories to pass the time. Applejack starts off by telling her and Apple Bloom's favorite legend: the legend of  .    In Applejack's story, Rockhoof is a scrawny   colt who lives in a village at the foot of a giant volcano. The village is protected by a group of elite pony guards called the Mighty Helm. Rockhoof dreamed of becoming a member of the Helm, but his weak stature and inability to lift an axe got in the way, bringing him ridicule from the other guardponies. One day, while Rockhoof was digging holes with his shovel, the volcano explosively erupts, threatening to cover the village in lava. Unable to think of a way to save the village, the Mighty Helm orders its immediate evacuation, but the villagers are reluctant to leave the home where they spent their entire lives. Rockhoof, however, uses his shovel to start digging a trench to divert the lava away from the village, even though he couldn't dig fast enough.   Suddenly, in the middle of Rockhoof's digging, a mysterious magic surrounds his shovel, and he transforms from a scrawny colt to a brawny stallion. With his newfound strength, Rockhoof is able to dig multiple times faster than before, and he successfully diverts the lava into the ocean. For his bravery and determination, Rockhoof is invited to join the Mighty Helm's ranks.    Back in the cave, Applejack's friends are very entertained by her story. Unfortunately, the Fly-der swarm has not yet moved on outside, having covered the ponies' entire campsite in spider webs. Sweetie Belle is disappointed to have abandoned their beautifully-made camp for such a drab-looking cave, but Rarity assures her that there is beauty in everything, which she demonstrates by uncovering flecks of gold in the cave walls and making shadow puppets. To further illustrate her point, Rarity decides to tell Sweetie Belle her favorite legend: the legend of  .

However, when she returns home, she finds it a dismal dictatorship where the empress keeps the villagers working all hours on her palace and takes everything with beauty for herself. Mistmane confronts Sable Spirit in her palace and demands an explanation. Sable explains that she was always jealous of Mistmane's beauty and talent, and after she left for magic school, Sable used a spell to make herself beautiful. The spell backfired, however, and made her hideous. Therefore, she decided if she couldn't have beauty, she would take it from everyone and everything else. Mistmane refuses to allow this, and she faces Sable Spirit in a magic duel. After a fierce clash of fire- and water-conjuring spells, Mistmane wins by trapping Sable in a cocoon of plant roots.   Afterward, Mistmane plants a flower at the center of the village and uses her magic to restore its beauty—as well as Sable Spirit's—while also sacrificing her own beauty. Sable Spirit is so moved by Mistmane's sacrifice that she rules with kindness and compassion from then on. Though Mistmane is no longer physically beautiful, she dedicates her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria.    Sweetie Belle is very moved by Rarity's story, declaring Mistmane to be her favorite legend as well. Suddenly, the Fly-der swarm outside the cave starts to make its way inside.

Therefore, Flash volunteers to lure the dragons away from their lair so that Ironhead and the rest of the Legion can retrieve their friends. Ironhead recognizes Flash's bravery and gives him the fireproof shield Netitus to assist in his mission.   After Flash gets the dragons' attention and lures them away from their lair, Ironhead and his soldiers infiltrate the cave.

Trixie, however, is skeptical about the existence of such a creature. Just then, an unreformed changeling appears before Starlight and Trixie, hissing menacingly at them. Starlight tries to fend off the attacking changeling with her magic, and Trixie tries to teleport them away, but the changeling quickly captures them. He takes them before Thorax, believing them to be trespassers, but Thorax says they are friends and to let them go. He apologizes to Starlight and Trixie for the rude welcome, explaining that the unreformed changeling is his older brother  .   Thorax says he has taken  's   and dealt with most of the renegade changelings, but Pharynx is the only one who still refuses to adopt the hive's new way of sharing love. As a result, all of the other changelings avoid him.    Thorax gives Starlight and Trixie a tour of the new Changeling Kingdom. Having abandoned their previous routines of hunting and patrolling, the changelings have adopted a variety of new activities including theater, dancing, arts and crafts, and the occasional potluck. Unfortunately, Pharynx constantly undermines these new ways, upsetting the rest of the changelings. Thorax fears if he can't convince Pharynx to accept love and friendship, it will cause the hive to question his leadership. While Thorax and his subjects leave to lure the maulwurf away from the kingdom, Trixie and Starlight offer to talk with Pharynx. The ponies approach the rebellious changeling and try to connect with him, having their own experiences with being outsiders among their own kind. However, despite their lives being richer for letting go of the past, Pharynx considers them both losers and tells them to stay away from him.   When Thorax returns, he shows Starlight and Trixie to the changelings' ""feelings forum"", where members of the hive come together to talk about their issues in a welcoming and open-minded environment. While the participants in the forum feel good talking about their problems, they are also very open about their grievances toward Pharynx. Pharynx enters to find his fellow changelings talking behind his back and voices his own outrage about the hive's weak and cowardly new ways. When Pharynx leaves, the rest of the changelings demand that he be banished from the Changeling Kingdom.   When the feelings forum is adjourned, Starlight regretfully considers the possibility that Pharynx is a lost cause and simply cannot be changed. Trixie agrees, and they decide to tell Thorax that he may have no choice than to banish his older brother. As they leave to talk to Thorax, Pharynx is revealed to have been listening in on their conversation. At Thorax's throne, Starlight and Trixie try to talk to him about Pharynx, and Thorax tells them a story about his and Pharynx's childhood. When they were little, while Pharynx occasionally made fun of Thorax for his sensitivity, he also protected him from other changelings' similar ridicule. Despite his rebelliousness, Thorax is certain that Pharynx loves him in his own way and that there is good in him. Moved by Thorax's story, Starlight changes her mind about pushing for Pharynx's banishment and comes up with another idea.   Outside the kingdom, Starlight lays a trail of leaves to lure the maulwurf to the hive. Her plan is to have Pharynx save the hive from the maulwurf so that the rest of the changelings will finally accept him. Unfortunately, Trixie cannot find Pharynx anywhere; having overheard their earlier conversation, Pharynx has apparently left the kingdom on his own.   Starlight and Trixie inform Thorax of this development; while the changelings are thrilled that Pharynx is gone, they are terrified that the maulwurf is headed their way. Upon learning that his brother is somewhere alone in the Badlands while the maulwurf is on the loose, he goes to save him, and Starlight and Trixie follow. The rest of the changelings, however, are too scared to also come along. Starlight attempts to rally the nervous changelings with an inspiring speech, saying that while they were forced to follow   against their will, Thorax's rule gives them the freedom to choose. Unfortunately, the changelings are unmoved by the speech, and Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax head out to find Pharynx by themselves. Somewhere in the desert, they find Pharynx battling the rampaging maulwurf on his own. Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax try to help him, but the maulwurf's thick hide makes it impervious to most of their attacks. Suddenly, the rest of the changeling swarm appears to provide support, but they are unable to help much due to being out of combat practice.   Pharynx comes up with an idea inspired by how he used to tease Thorax when they were little, and the changeling brothers team up to make the maulwurf hit itself over and over. When the maulwurf's stamina is worn down enough, it retreats underground.    Thorax asks Pharynx why he challenged the maulwurf if he was leaving the hive.

The   was designed by Herring.     The episode opens with   buying a copy of the   newspaper and mentioning to   the various goings-on around  , though Rainbow is largely uninterested. When Pinkie reads the headline ""Author A. K. Yearling Announces Retirement"", Rainbow's interest is instantly sparked.  Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie race to  's jungle cottage, with Rainbow believing her sudden retirement is covering up something terrible. At the cottage, Rainbow frantically knocks at the door, and Yearling invites them inside with a depressed expression. When asked why she's retiring so suddenly before her next book is published, Yearling explains that her latest adventure in Southern   turned up multiple news articles disparaging Daring Do and blaming her for the damage that her adventures cause. This has caused her to lose confidence in herself as both an adventurer and as a writer. Rainbow Dash is certain that the ponies Daring Do has helped far outnumber those she unintentionally harmed, and she suggests traveling to Southern Equestria to disprove the rumors circulating about her.    Upon arriving in the desert village of  , Rainbow Dash starts asking around about Daring Do, but the villagers condemn her for destroying several objects around the village, including the sacred statue of its  . One of the villagers—a mysterious stallion in a red cloak—supports these claims, calling Daring Do ""a menace who destroys everything she touches"". A. K. Yearling's confidence is broken even more, and she runs out of the village in shame. Determined to make Yearling realize that ponies appreciate Daring Do, Rainbow and Pinkie follow her to the Get On Inn, a barn-and-breakfast where she commonly stays during her adventures. There, they talk to the manager   about Daring Do, and Mrs. Trotsworth criticizes her for not only leaving without paying her bill but also luring a band of ruffians that destroyed half the rooms looking for her. In addition, there have also been recent reports of Daring Do stealing glowpaz from villagers looking to offer it to Somnambula's statue.   Rainbow and Pinkie find A. K. Yearling at an inn table, and they overhear the same red-cloaked stallion from earlier continue to publicly condemn Daring Do to the villagers. Yearling denies all allegations of stealing glowpaz, and Rainbow assures her that they'll fix all of this after a good night's sleep.    The next morning, Rainbow, Pinkie, Yearling, and the villagers congregate at the broken Somnambula statue in the village square. There, the stallion in the red cloak continues to publicly slander Daring Do's name. Rainbow Dash steps forward to challenge the cloaked stallion's claims, arguing that Daring Do's actions have been nothing but heroic. However, when she belittles the destroyed statue, one of the villagers speaks up to defend the legendary pony that the village was named after. Long ago, the once-unnamed village fell under siege by an evil   that demanded most of their crops as tribute. To keep the poor villagers from giving up hope, Somnambula used what little she had to give them food.  , the son of the pharaoh, was so moved by Somnambula's compassion that he stood up to the sphinx to free the villagers from her tyranny. However, the sphinx captured Hisan and told the pharaoh that she would only set him free if someone solved her riddle.   Somnambula volunteered to try and solve the sphinx's riddle: ""I shine brightest in the dark. I am there but cannot be seen. To have me costs you nothing. To be without me costs you everything."" Somnambula correctly answers ""hope"", enraging the sphinx. Fearing that the sphinx would go back on her promise to release Hisan, Somnambula asks for another challenge and tells the sphinx to leave the kingdom forever if she completes it. The sphinx challenges Somnambula to walk across a bridge to Hisan—blindfolded and without the use of her wings. Guided by Hisan's voice and the power of hope, Somnambula succeeds, and the sphinx flies off in a rage. Hisan replaces Somnambula's pearls with a string of glowpaz as thanks for saving him, and glowpaz became the village's symbol of hope from then on.    Rainbow reminds the villagers of how both Daring Do and Somnambula fought to protect their home, but the stallion in the red cloak reminds them of how Daring Do destroyed the statue in the first place. As the villagers curse Daring Do's name, A. K. Yearling walks off with her reputation in ruins. Rainbow Dash finally confronts the cloaked stallion about his vendetta against Daring Do, and he reveals himself to be  . He thanks Rainbow for helping him break Daring Do's spirit once and for all, and he and his   capture her before she can tell Daring the truth. As Rainbow cries out for help, Pinkie Pie and A. K. Yearling see Caballeron and his henchponies drag her away. Pinkie follows Caballeron through the desert, and Daring Do—discarding her A. K. Yearling persona—follows shortly afterward. After the damage done to her reputation, Daring is unsure of herself, but Pinkie reminds her that she'd never let anything bad happen to Rainbow. With this boost in confidence, Daring pursues Caballeron to the pyramid, where he has trapped Rainbow Dash in the same way that the sphinx trapped Hisan in Somnambula's story.   Rainbow Dash starts to slowly sink into a pit of green slime, and the sphinx's magic still prevents the use of wings. Inspired by Somnambula's story, Daring Do and Pinkie Pie take a leap of faith, using steam vents to jump across the slime pit and save Rainbow. A short while later, the three intercept Caballeron and his henchponies as they leave the village. Glowpaz spills out of the large bag they're dragging, revealing them to be the ones who stole from the villagers. Caballeron reveals that his defamation of Daring Do's name was to remove her from the picture so he could carry out his plans unhindered. However, Daring Do has gotten her confidence back, and with his evil plans exposed and the villagers turned against him, Caballeron runs off in defeat.    The villagers of Somnambula cheer for Daring Do, and she thanks Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie for helping her. Daring vows to try and be more responsible for her actions in the future and to never lose hope if she does something she didn't mean to do. With that lesson, she decides not to retire from writing books, and she uses her personal funds to replace the village's damaged carts, reimburse Mrs. Trotsworth, and restore the Somnambula statue.

During her moss collection, Zecora slips and falls into the swamp water, and she floats past a lilypad flower that sprays her with pollen. When Zecora emerges from the water, she suddenly finds herself covered in orange spots, much to Fluttershy's alarm. Later, at  's office, Zecora has starting coughing up bubbles. After an examination, the doctor diagnoses Zecora with  , a rare disease characterized by orange spots, bubble-coughs, and shock-sneezes. In the disease's final stage, the victim transforms into a tree that drops the flowers that spread the disease. Even worse, no cure for Swamp Fever has been discovered.   Feeling guilty for getting Zecora sick, Fluttershy promises to find someone who can help. Zecora tells her about a legendary masked healer from long ago who cured many diseases before mysteriously vanishing without a trace. Fluttershy knows of the legend of this ""Mystical Mask"" from stories that her   told her when she was little. Fluttershy and Zecora believe the Mystical Mask really exists, and Fluttershy is determined to seek her out.    At the  , Fluttershy interrupts a cooking competition between   and   and asks for help in learning more about the Mystical Mask. Unfortunately, after several hours of searching the castle library, Twilight and Fluttershy fail to find anything. Twilight suggests turning in for some well-needed sleep, but Fluttershy refuses to rest until Zecora is healed. The next morning, Fluttershy excitedly wakes up Twilight and tells her that she has discovered the Mystical Mask's true identity:  , the legendary sorceress of   who disappeared a long time ago. Fluttershy wants to head to the swamp to see if Meadowbrook left anything behind. Twilight mentions Fluttershy's lack of sleep, but Fluttershy still refuses to rest and urges Twilight out the door.   Before leaving for Hayseed Swamp, Fluttershy and Twilight check in on Zecora, whose condition has worsened to the point where she is sneezing bolts of lightning and unable to speak in rhyme. As Fluttershy and Twilight hurriedly take their leave, Fluttershy bumps into Zecora's door due to her sleep deprivation. Fluttershy and Twilight fly to Hayseed Swamp and find a seemingly abandoned bayou village. They discover Mage Meadowbrook's old home built out of a large, twisted tree. Inside, they find samples of the same flower that infected Zecora, and they meet the home's caretaker and a descendant of Meadowbrook's named  . Upon learning of Fluttershy and Twilight's situation, Cattail grants them access to Meadowbrook's old medical journals.    One of Meadowbrook's journals says that, after she perfected a cure for the sniffles, she was given her own healer's mask by  . One day,   appeared on their doorstep with Swamp Fever. Using the flowers that spread the disease, Meadowbrook and her mother tried to make a cure but made little progress. Before long, the disease spread to the other villagers, including Meadowbrook's mother, leaving Meadowbrook to find a cure on her own. While observing the flowers in the swamp, Meadowbrook noticed a swarm of   collecting nectar from them, immune to their poison. Reasoning that the bees' honey contains the cure for Swamp Fever, Meadowbrook follows the swarm to their hive and tries to collect some. However, the overly protective swarm attacks Meadowbrook with their electrified stingers, preventing her from reaching the honey. Therefore, she put on her healer's mask and came up with a plan.   Meadowbrook eventually succeeded in retrieving the flash bees' honey and curing everyone in the village, though her journal doesn't say exactly how she accomplished it. In her final entries, she wrote that she would dedicate her life to curing ponies all over Equestria—which, according to Cattail, she did up until her disappearance.    With the information given by Meadowbrook's journal, Fluttershy decides to seek out the flash bee swarm and secure some of their honey for Zecora. However, Twilight and Cattail notice orange spots on Fluttershy's body, indicating she has also caught Swamp Fever. Fluttershy puts masks on Twilight and Cattail to keep them from getting infected and prepares to head to collect the honey. Twilight and Cattail urge her not to push herself and worsen her symptoms, but she is still determined to see her mission through and confident in her ability to reason with the bees. Cattail leads Fluttershy to the flash bees' hive, and Fluttershy tries asking them for some of their honey, but they sting her in response. Fluttershy tries using the Stare on the bees, but they prove immune to it and sting her even more. After receiving the swarm's aggression, Fluttershy finally succumbs to her intense exhaustion and loses consciousness.   When Fluttershy reawakens in Meadowbrook's house, Twilight and Cattail reveal that she has been unconscious for three days and that Zecora's condition has worsened to the point where leaves have started growing on her body. Fluttershy is distraught about wasting so much time, and Twilight and Cattail say they have already tried everything they could to reach the honey. Just then, a flash bee flies into the room and starts to nuzzle Meadowbrook's mask affectionately.  Back at the flash bees' hive, Fluttershy explains that the stripes on Meadowbrook's mask resemble those of the queen bee, causing the male bees to become docile around it. Using the mask as a disguise, Fluttershy poses as the flash bees' queen and succeeds in taking some of their honey.    Some time later, at Zecora's hut, a cured and fully-rested Fluttershy feeds the honey to Zecora, and she makes an instant recovery. Zecora thanks Fluttershy for the struggles she went through to cure her, but Fluttershy admits that she could've helped Zecora sooner if she listened to Twilight and didn't disregard her own health.

Unable to work with blank flanks one at a time, the Crusaders decide to open a Cutie Mark Day Camp so they can help multiple blank flanks at once as well as foster teamwork among the foals themselves. Because they need a wide open area with a lot of activities for it, they decide to open their day camp at Camp Friendship, where   and   used to go when they were little.   As the Crusaders advertise their day camp in  , they see   passing by and extend a flyer invitation for him to join. Rumble starts stomping on the flyer when his older brother   appears. He flies off wanting to show Thunderlane a new flying trick he's been practicing, but Thunderlane notices the crumpled-up flyer and gets an idea.    Some time later, the Crusaders open their camp to the blanks flanks of Ponyville, encouraging a variety of fun activities and fostering togetherness as they try out for their  . When Thunderlane arrives to drop off Rumble, the rest of the foals marvel at meeting one of the  , and Thunderlane briefly impresses them with his horseshoe-tossing and aerial skills before flying off to Wonderbolts practice. Throughout the day, Rumble shows little to no enthusiasm for the camp activities, from horseshoe-tossing to kayaking to archery to line-dancing to writing haikus. Not having any fun, he eventually flies off. In his absence, Kettle Corn gets her cutie mark in haiku-writing. Even though she isn't a blank flank anymore, she wants to come back to camp and keep painting circles, which   happily encourages.   The Crusaders are proud that their day camp is such a success, but they worry about Rumble and his lack of enthusiasm, figuring that he is feeling discouraged by a supposed failure at his activities. They find him at the Wonderbolts' practice stadium watching them perform. The Crusaders apologize for failing to find something that Rumble can excel in, and they promise to help him get his cutie mark.  The Crusaders are shocked by Rumble's declaration and ask him why he doesn't want a cutie mark. Rumble explains that cutie marks force ponies to do only one thing for their entire lives, using the Crusaders themselves and their cutie mark counseling as an example. When the Crusaders fail to convince him otherwise, he flies off in frustration again. The Crusaders decide not to force Rumble and help the rest of the camp foals.    On the Ponyville racetrack, Rumble practices his aerial diving when Thunderlane appears and breaks his concentration. Rumble expresses some frustration at being interrupted, and his brother apologizes, saying he's sure that Rumble will be a great flyer one day. When asked why he isn't at cutie mark camp, Rumble says he doesn't want to get a cutie mark in any of their activities. Regardless, Thunderlane says he's going back the next day, saying he ""can't be a blank flank forever"". His words gives Rumble an idea. The next day, the Crusaders' day camp lets out after jam-making, though   is upset that he still doesn't have his cutie mark. As he expresses concern about getting a cutie mark in something he's good at or something he likes to do, Rumble bursts in spouting his ideology on how cutie marks limit ponies to doing just one thing. He suddenly   and slowly turns the rest of the campers over to his way of thinking, much to the Crusaders' dismay. At the end of the song, Rumble declares that he's opening his own camp on the other end of Camp Friendship where foals embrace being blank flanks.   A short while later, the Crusaders watch from afar as Rumble's campers engage in activities that aren't very different from the activities they were doing before. They confront Rumble and argue that cutie marks make ponies special, but Rumble and the foals refuse to listen. They go back to doing camp activities, but when they start having fun and fear getting their cutie marks in those activities, they stop doing the activities altogether.    As the Crusaders get even more annoyed with Rumble's stubbornness, the Wonderbolts fly over the camp, and Scootaloo thinks of someone who can reason with him. Back at the practice stadium, the Crusaders explain the situation to Thunderlane, who reveals that Rumble is actually good at all the camp's activities. Thunderlane explains that ever since he became a Wonderbolt, Rumble has watched him constantly and wanted to fly like him. Because he wants to be a Wonderbolt himself someday, he refuses to give anything else a chance.   realizes Rumble isn't afraid of doing just one thing—he's afraid that one thing will prevent him from realizing his dream.  Back at camp, Rumble and the other foals have become bored from not doing anything. Suddenly, the Crusaders return—with special guest Thunderlane—and invite the foals to do camp activities and play games with a member of the Wonderbolts. Little by little, the foals are convinced to return to the Crusaders' camp, leaving Rumble all by himself. Jealous of the fun his fellow blank flanks are having, Rumble eventually joins in. He sees Thunderlane making food, and Thunderlane says even though his cutie mark is about going fast, he really likes to cook.   Finally convinced that ponies aren't limited by their cutie marks, Rumble joins his brother in making food. When the Crusaders invite him to run the camp obstacle course, Rumble says he'll do it tomorrow and that he's no longer worried about what kind of cutie mark he'll get.     "

Nonetheless, each family member has an activity to look forward: a bingo competition for Night Light, boat races for Shining Armor, princess daycare for Cadance and Flurry Heart,   barrel-jumping for Twilight Velvet, and everyone watching the Northern Stars together when the zeppelin passes through the Frozen North for Twilight.

Rainbow thanks Pinkie for the gesture and takes the pie inside the barracks with her, and Pinkie is satisfied by her friend's happiness. But when a janitor comes out of the barracks to take out the trash, Pinkie notices the pie she made sitting on top of the trash bin.   After the janitor dumps the trash in the compactor, Pinkie asks him about it, and he says he doesn't remember seeing a pie in the trash, leading Pinkie to believe she was just seeing things.   Later that same day, in her party-planning cave under Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie Pie dwells heavily on the pie-in-the-trash incident and starts to wonder if she wasn't seeing things. She thinks back on several past occasions and realizes every time she gave Rainbow Dash a pie, Rainbow would make her look away in the other direction, and the pies would mysteriously disappear while her back was turned. Realizing she has never actually seen Rainbow eat one of her pies, Pinkie Pie decides to launch a thorough investigation.  Pinkie interrogates the other Wonderbolts and learns that they have been receiving unexplained pie donations on a monthly basis. Then, she interrogates   and learns that Rainbow Dash's pet   was diagnosed with indigestion from excess sugar the day after Pinkie made a pie for Rainbow. Finally, she interrogates   and discovers that Rainbow Dash donates her half-birthday pie to the   every year. After piecing everything together, Pinkie Pie comes to the horrifying conclusion that Rainbow Dash doesn't like pie and has been lying to her about it for years.    stumbles into Pinkie's party-planning cave while delivering apples and finds Pinkie agonizing over her discovery. While Applejack finds the idea of Rainbow Dash hating pie ridiculous, the more she thinks about it, the more she also realizes that she has never actually seen Rainbow eating pie. Applejack tries to get Pinkie's mind off of it by asking her to make pies for her family's apple harvest, but Pinkie instead comes up with the idea of making Rainbow Dash so many pies that she will eventually admit the truth. The next day, Pinkie Pie makes Rainbow Dash pies for when she wakes up, for her seventy-fourth Wonderbolt training session, as part of a scheme to get Rainbow to save her from the top of a pyramid of pies, and as thanks for saving her from the pyramid of pies. Unfortunately, Rainbow outsmarts Pinkie at every turn and manages to get rid of the pies without having to eat any.   Later, an increasingly crazy Pinkie Pie puts together a large pie-eating party in  , and when Rainbow arrives, Pinkie tries to get her to eat one without blinking. However, Rainbow toys with her pie long enough for Pinkie to blink, and she ties the pie to a balloon and makes it float away before Pinkie opens her eyes. Frustrated beyond belief, Pinkie openly accuses Rainbow Dash of hating her pies and lying about it, and Rainbow Dash denies it until the pie she tied to a balloon falls on Pinkie's head. Despite Rainbow's poorly-thought-out excuses and wanting to explain, Pinkie storms off in anger.   At the  , Rainbow Dash feels guilty for lying to Pinkie about liking pie, and Twilight and Applejack wonder if she's been lying about anything else. She defends herself by saying she knows how much Pinkie likes making pies and it would have hurt her to learn Rainbow doesn't like them. When Twilight and Applejack point out how hurt Pinkie already is, Rainbow comes up with an idea to make it up to her.  Some time later, Pinkie Pie sulks in her bedroom, and Rainbow draws her to her window with a terrible smell. Rainbow apologizes to Pinkie for lying to her all this time, and in an effort to make it up to her, she has made a giant pie to eat right in front of her – despite how disgusting it looks. Unable to watch her friend do this, Pinkie Pie stops her and finally understands why Rainbow lied: because it made Pinkie happy to see her friends enjoy her pies, and it made Rainbow happy to see Pinkie happy. Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash reconcile with a hug, and Pinkie tells Rainbow that she can always be honest with her in the future.     "

Curious about where the Pillars went after they defeated the Pony of Shadows, Twilight and Sunburst decide to apply their knowledge of ancient Equestrian history to decipher the rest of Star Swirl's writings.   After three days of research and cross-referencing, Twilight and her friends have made little progress in deciphering Star Swirl's writings, largely due to their illegibility.

The ponies travel to the ancient temple of Ponhenge and find several rock formations with magical runes carved into them. When Twilight places Star Swirl's journal on one of the rock platforms, it activates an old holographic recording of Star Swirl, Rockhoof, Mistmane, Flash Magnus, Somnambula, and Mage Meadowbrook. In the recording, the Pillars of Old Equestria use talismans of the elements they each represent to seal away the Pony of Shadows, sacrificing themselves in the process.    After deciphering more of Star Swirl's writings, Twilight learns that the Pillars of Old Equestria used a spell to trap the Pony of Shadows in  —a space between worlds where time stands still.

Meanwhile, Twilight looks for a solution in the castle library, feeling regret for unleashing a great evil upon Equestria just to meet her idol. She soon finds a portal spell that could banish the Pony of Shadows to limbo without sacrificing the Pillars. Starlight Glimmer suggests a solution that doesn't involve banishment, but Twilight is confident in Star Swirl's plan and wants to prove herself to him.   Twilight's friends and the rest of the Pillars travel across Equestria in search of the Pony of Shadows, and the Pillars are surprised at how much Equestria has changed over the last thousand years. Later, back at the castle, the Pony of Shadows' possible whereabouts are narrowed down. When Twilight enters to share her idea of banishing the Pony of Shadows without sacrificing the Pillars, Star Swirl dismisses her again, but her friends stand up for her, and Star Swirl begrudgingly gives her idea some consideration.   As the ponies wonder where the Pony of Shadows is hiding, the Mane Six's   suddenly start to glow, and the Cutie Map points them toward a remote, abandoned region of Equestria called the  . After finally giving Twilight some praise, Star Swirl leaves to prepare the new banishment spell while the others prepare for battle. Like before, Starlight Glimmer opts for a more peaceful solution than banishment, but Star Swirl refuses to consider it, saying ""Once a villain, always a villain."" With Star Swirl and Twilight refusing to listen, Starlight asks the other Pillars about the Pony of Shadows. Long ago, the beast was originally a unicorn named  , who brought the Pillars together against the threat of the  . As the Pillars were hailed as heroes, the ordinary Stygian became jealous of their abilities and stole artifacts from them for a spell. The Pillars cast him out as punishment for his actions. When Stygian later appeared before them again, he was consumed by darkness and revenge and became the Pony of Shadows. When asked what spell Stygian was trying to cast, the Pillars admit they don't know for sure, but they believe it was to steal their powers for himself.   Starlight approaches Star Swirl and Twilight again, still curious about Stygian's true motives back then. When Star Swirl asserts that Stygian was driven purely by envy and that there is no return from the path he chose, Starlight argues that she herself is living proof of the contrary. She tries to convince Twilight that the map is calling her and her friends for a friendship problem, but Star Swirl maintains there is no way to befriend a pony like Stygian. In the  , Star Swirl extracts the Elements of Harmony from the Tree of Harmony, calling them a necessary sacrifice to banish the Pony of Shadows. With the Elements still attuned to Twilight and her friends, the Mane Six and Pillars team up in pairs to use their magic.    Upon reaching the Hollow Shades, the Mane Six and Pillars challenge the Pony of Shadows. They are suddenly dragged underground to the Well of Shade, where Stygian had originally become one with the darkness, and the Pony of Shadows appears before them. The beast bears contempt toward the Pillars for turning their backs on him, and Twilight starts to believe Starlight was right about this being a friendship problem. The ponies cast their spell and open a portal to limbo, and the Pony of Shadows starts getting dragged inside. Before Twilight can complete the spell, she sees Stygian's true form sticking out of the Pony of Shadows' body, and she flies inside. At the depths of the darkness, Twilight finds Stygian despairing over his friends' betrayal. When Twilight claims   betrayed the other Pillars by trying to steal their power, Stygian argues that he only wanted the Pillars' respect. Wishing to help them in their battles, he took their artifacts so he could replicate them and become a Pillar as well; the Pillars hear this and realize how wrong they were. The darkness inside Stygian starts to consume him again, but Twilight offers to help him overcome it, and Starlight enters to support her.   The Mane Six and Pillars of Old Equestria work together to free Stygian from the darkness, and the darkness is banished to limbo. Because the ponies used the Elements of Harmony for healing instead of banishment, the Elements remain intact. Star Swirl apologizes to Stygian for letting pride cloud his judgment and driving him away, and he thanks Twilight for helping him and his fellow Pillars see the error of their ways. The Mane Six's cutie marks glow again, indicating a successful friendship mission.   Some time later, in  , Star Swirl reunites with his old pupils   and  . The princesses ask Star Swirl to stay and teach magic again, but Star Swirl decides to travel and see how much Equestria has changed before settling down in one place.

The episode begins at a comedy club in  , where   gives a stand-up routine. Her jokes get little response from the audience, but   laughs at everything she says. After the club, Pinkie wants to celebrate Maud's ""successful"" comedy routine, but Maud says she has other plans later that evening. Pinkie Pie is disappointed that Maud has had other plans for the past several days and they haven't spent much time together lately. Before Maud can explain the reason for this, Pinkie says they can still spend time together before Maud's upcoming birthday, and they make plans to hang out the following morning.   However, when Pinkie goes to meet Maud at her cavern home the next morning, Maud is strangely not there. She searches all over town for Maud, even in   and the  , but Maud is nowhere to be found. Pinkie checks in with   at the  , but Maud is not there either. When she tells Starlight about her plans with Maud that morning, Starlight agrees to go looking for her while Pinkie goes to buy the cake for Maud's surprise birthday party.   At a bakery shop in Ponyville, Pinkie tries to buy some ingredients for Maud's birthday cake, but an   stallion in front of her takes a long time to finish his order. The stallion speaks with an odd, awkward tone and says ""technically"" very frequently, which annoys Pinkie. By the time he finishes his business with  , the owner has gone on a lunch break, preventing Pinkie from making her own order. As Pinkie expresses frustration over meeting such an annoying pony, she finally finds Maud. Maud apologizes for not being around to hang out with Pinkie that day and reveals she has been busy lately because she has a boyfriend. At first, Pinkie is very excited that her sister is in a relationship, but when Maud introduces Pinkie to her boyfriend, it is revealed to be the annoying stallion she met in the bakery, named  . Maud explains that the two of them met during a rock show, and Mudbriar is as passionate about sticks as Maud is about rocks.   Though they have much in common and make each other smile, Pinkie still thinks Mudbriar's mannerisms and constantly pointing out technicalities are annoying and weird. She tells Starlight about Mudbriar later and thinks he and Maud are nothing alike, but Starlight says Maud must like him for a reason and that Pinkie just needs to get to know him better. She suggests that Pinkie and Mudbriar plan Maud's birthday party together while she keeps Maud busy, and Pinkie begrudgingly agrees.   Pinkie Pie brings Mudbriar to her party planning cave under  —which Mudbriar points out is technically a cavern instead of a cave. As Pinkie shares her plans for Maud's surprise party, Mudbriar claims that Maud doesn't like surprise parties or any of the activities Pinkie has planned. Pinkie takes offense to the notion that Mudbriar knows Maud better than she does and suggests asking her straight out. On a hill where Starlight and Maud are flying kites, Pinkie and Mudbriar appear, and Pinkie asks Maud whether or not she likes surprise parties. Maud explains that, while she likes surprise parties because it makes Pinkie happy to throw them, she would prefer a smaller party with just Pinkie, Starlight, and Mudbriar. In disbelief over this revelation, Pinkie admits that Mudbriar is impossible to like and accuses Maud of choosing him over her.   Maud insists that she didn't choose either of them over the other and says Mudbriar makes her happy, even adopting some of his mannerisms. Realizing she is losing her best-sister-friend to someone she doesn't like, Pinkie leaves in tears.   On top of a bridge, Pinkie Pie tries to make sense of how Maud could like someone like Mudbriar, briefly entertaining the thought of it being ""Opposite Day"". In her increasing loss of sanity, she runs away to the   rock farm. The next morning, Pinkie wakes up to do farm chores with her sisters  . Unable to find a solution to her dilemma, she asks them why Maud would like Mudbriar and what he has that she doesn't. Limestone and Marble lead Pinkie over to what appears to be an ordinary rock. When Marble cracks it open, it's revealed to be a geode with sparkling blue gems inside. Limestone explains that Pinkie may see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a beautiful gem. Even if Pinkie can't see past Mudbriar's dullness, all that matters is how happy he makes Maud. Pinkie thanks her sisters for their insight.   Back in Ponyville, Pinkie returns to help Mudbriar wrap a birthday present for Maud, and she extends an olive branch to him in truce and apology. Though Mudbriar points out that her gift is technically a quercus and not an olive branch, he accepts Pinkie's apology and friendship, and they team up again to plan Maud's party.    At the end of the episode, ponies gather outside Town Hall for Maud's birthday, but the pony of honor is just a cardboard cutout. Meanwhile, the real Maud has a smaller party on a nearby hill with Pinkie and Mudbriar like she wanted. Maud is pleased with this outcome, and Pinkie gives Mudbriar all the credit for the idea. Mudbriar continues to point out technicalities, much to Pinkie's frustration, but she bears with it and has a group hug with Maud and her boyfriend.    "

When   looks after  's  , she takes on a series of characters to cope with the intimidating clientele.   The basic premise for this episode was originally pitched by  .  is   from the season one episode  . A   adaptation of the episode is included in the August 9, 2018   published by Orchard Books in the United Kingdom; this adaptation's last two pages were released online as part of the book's December 12, 2017 preview,  predating the announcement of this episode.     The episode begins at the Sweet Feather Sanctuary, where   has a picnic with all of her   friends. Suddenly,   arrives with a crisis: the   Royal Fashion Show is taking place soon, and she is having trouble finishing the centerpiece dress of the new collection she plans to debut. She intends to have   and her three   boutique assistants help her finish the dress, but it would leave Rarity For You without any employees to run it during Manehattan's busiest shopping season. Having already asked the rest of their friends, Rarity turns to Fluttershy for help in running the store, and Fluttershy agrees. At Rarity For You, Rarity explains to Fluttershy the various sections that the boutique is split up into—including chic, classic, and modern—and how to run the cash register. When   enters the store, Fluttershy practices making a sale, but she gets intimidated by the customer's brazen Manehattan personality. Once Rarity sees to the customer's needs, she tells Fluttershy not to be timid and to simply access the strength and confidence she has within.   Before Rarity departs for Canterlot with her boutique assistants, she leaves Fluttershy with the help of   She also suggests that Fluttershy put on an outfit to help her get into her new role as a salespony.   When another customer enters the boutique, Fluttershy tries once again to see to their needs, but she is again intimidated by their forward personality and sophisticated demands. She retreats to the store's back room, where the raccoons encourage her to follow Rarity's advice and put on an outfit. In this outfit, Fluttershy adopts a more sophisticated and haughty persona to match that of the customer, and she is able to make a sale. On her way to the Manehattan train station, Rarity starts to have second thoughts about leaving Fluttershy alone around the high-and-mighty personalities around in the city. But when she hears from one of Rarity For You's customers about how well Fluttershy performed, she feels reassured and continues on toward Canterlot.   Back at Rarity For You, Fluttershy's ""sophisticated salespony"" character results in good business for the store, but it clashes with the Valley girl-type customers, so Fluttershy adopts a second new persona to accommodate. When she meets customers with Goth personalities, Fluttershy adopts a third new persona to match them. However, as Fluttershy gets deeper into her characters, she starts to snap at her raccoon friends for not catering to the customers properly, and she even starts to drive away customers with her over-the-top personalities. She eventually gets so upset with the raccoons that they quit and leave.   At the  , Smoky, Softpad, and Smoky Jr. inform   and   of what's been happening in Manehattan, and they go to gather the rest of their friends together. They travel to Manehattan's Saddle Row and witness firsthand how rude Fluttershy is acting toward the customers in her new salespony personas. The ponies try to talk to her, but she continues to act as her salespony characters toward them and dismisses her raccoon friends as unwanted rodents. When they try to tell her there's a better way to address the customers, she kicks them out of the boutique. At the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show, Rarity and her designer assistants still struggle with the centerpiece dress of Rarity's new collection. When her friends arrive to inform her of what's going on at Rarity For You, the news comes as a considerable surprise to her, and she agrees to help resolve the situation.    Back at Rarity For You, Fluttershy continues to upset and offend her customers with her personas' remarks. When Rarity sees the state the shop is in and Fluttershy's insensitive views toward its clientele, she fires Fluttershy three times—once for each of her individual new personas. Finally dropping the act, Fluttershy apologizes for taking her salespony characters too far and for hurting her raccoon friends' feelings. She explains that acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave her the confidence to interact with them. Rarity tells Fluttershy that she wanted a friend to run her shop instead of someone like the rude ponies of Saddle Row and that she already had all the strength and confidence she needed to run it. This lesson gives Rarity the inspiration she needs to finish the centerpiece dress of her new collection.   With Fluttershy as her model, Rarity debuts her ""Warrior of Inner Strength"" dress to the ponies of Manehattan, and it is met with great positive reception. Fluttershy feels sorry that Rarity had to leave the Canterlot fashion show early, but Rarity insists that making the perfect dress is more satisfying than showing it off. When   insinuates that Rarity's dress debut is an attempt to undercut the Canterlot fashion show, Fluttershy demonstrates her real inner strength by telling the pony off.      "

Rainbow doesn't want to look after a group of slow, elderly ponies, but she agrees for the sake of riding the Wild Blue Yonder before it closes.   As the Gold Horseshoe Gals board the Las Pegasus-bound hot-air balloon, Applejack gives Rainbow a list of rules to follow while chaperoning them, including making sure they don't overexert themselves and not letting them out of her sight. Rainbow wonders how she's going to ride the rollercoaster while following Applejack's rules, and Applejack tells her she'll find time and even learn how to have a good time from the elder mares.    After a slow and boring balloon ride, Rainbow Dash and the Gold Horseshoe Gals arrive at Las Pegasus, where Rainbow is thrilled to discover the Wild Blue Yonder is inside the very hotel where they are staying. As they check into the hotel, the elderly ponies are eager to participate in some exciting hotel games and activities, but Rainbow Dash remembers Applejack's rules. Not wanting anything to jeopardize her chances of riding the rollercoaster, she encourages the others to get some rest in their hotel room. The Gold Horseshoe Gals pretend to agree and retire to their beds. While the elderly ponies sleep, Rainbow tries to get a ticket to ride the Wild Blue Yonder, but the wait line is very long. With her chaperone responsibilities a priority, she begrudgingly gives her spot in line to someone else.

Rainbow Dash frantically searches the hotel for the missing old ponies, but she's unable to find them. But when she hears a crowd chanting Goldie Delicious' name, she finds them in the arcade playing a horseshoe-tossing game. The other hotel ponies are greatly impressed by their horseshoe skills, and even Rainbow Dash is impressed. However, she remembers Applejack's rule about not letting the old ponies get too excited, and she ends the game prematurely, much to everyone else's disappointment. Granny Smith suggests going to the hotel's buffet next. But when she picks up a plate of hard, crunchy nachos, Rainbow remembers Applejack's rule about only letting the old ponies eat soft food, and she gives them carrot soup instead, making them even more disappointed. Rainbow hears over the hotel's P.A. system that only one day remains before the Wild Blue Yonder is closed. She once again tries to get the Gold Horseshoe Gals to take it easy during their trip, but the old ponies refuse and want to go dancing instead.

They invite the gals to their magic show at the Ponet Fantastique theater later that evening and give them complimentary VIP tickets to the event. Realizing their evening will drag on even longer, Rainbow Dash starts to lose hope that she'll ever get a chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder.   During Big Bucks and Jack Pot's magic show, they invite the Gold Horseshoe Gals onstage to be assistants in their signature magic trick. The trick involves the gals trying to escape from a tank filled with water. Rainbow Dash, fearing for the gals' safety, interrupts the magic trick and knocks the water tank over. Big Bucks and Jack Pot quickly leave the stage, and the Gold Horseshoe Gals chew Rainbow out for ruining their chance at performing with their favorite magicians.  The gals finally voice their frustration at Rainbow Dash for interrupting or ruining every activity they wanted to do throughout their Las Pegasus trip. Rainbow Dash apologizes to the gals and admits she just wanted to ride the Wild Blue Yonder, but her responsibilities to them as enforced by Applejack got in the way. The gals are annoyed by Applejack's over-worrying, and Rainbow fears she'll never get to ride the rollercoaster because of the long wait line. Luckily, the Gold Horseshoe Gals use their Las Pegasus VIP connections to skip to the front of the wait line, and Rainbow Dash is finally able to ride the Wild Blue Yonder, much to her delight.

Sunburst is similarly frustrated by all the letters that his mother sends him, asking what his plans are for the future. Starlight and Sunburst agree to stand up to their parents when they arrive so that they can focus on their friendship mission.    When Starlight and Sunburst arrive at Sire's Hollow, they discover a gate at the village entrance that was never there before, and several shops in town have been replaced by new, more urban businesses.

To that end, she announces a teamwork field trip—which she feels is a job that a Teacher of the Month would be worthy of leading. Applejack and Rainbow Dash both volunteer for the task, believing their respective lifestyles and everyday jobs qualify them to lead a field trip. As they start to argue over which of them is more qualified to lead, Fluttershy suggests they lead the field trip together, and Twilight agrees. Rainbow Dash and Applejack agree that, although they have been competitive in the past, they will not let that get in the way of their students' education.

As the class begins their first outdoor activity, Twilight leaves and says she'll check up on them later.    Applejack leads the class in the teamwork-building exercise of constructing an apple shed. While she directs the class to work slowly and carefully, Rainbow Dash wants to work quickly so that they can get to the activity she has planned. This results in more disagreements between the two teachers as they argue over who is more qualified to be Teacher of the Month, and the students become uncomfortable being forced to decide between them. Later, Rainbow Dash leads the class in river-canoeing, wanting in particular to break the river-canoeing speed record. While the students cooperate well and help Yona overcome her fear of the water, Applejack and Rainbow Dash continue to argue—to the point of paddling the canoe in opposite directions. When the canoe finally moves down the stream and heads toward a split path, the two teachers give conflicting instructions, causing the canoe to crash into the rocks.   After Ocellus and Silverstream help Yona because of her inability to swim, Twilight returns to see how things are going. When she sees the sorry state that the class is in, Applejack and Rainbow Dash cast blame on each other. Twilight admonishes the two for still letting their competitiveness get the better of them and neglecting their students' education. Because of their obsession with winning the Teacher of the Month award, Twilight says she is taking over as field trip leader. Applejack and Rainbow Dash realize their mistakes, and they each acknowledge the leadership that the other displayed throughout the day. They ask Twilight for another chance to teach their students about teamwork, and Twilight begrudgingly agrees but says she will be picking their next activity: a nature walk.    Applejack and Rainbow Dash lead the class on a walk through the woods. When they come across a fork in the road, the students fear another argument. Instead of arguing, however, each of the two teachers keep insisting on letting the other choose which way to go. When they fail to come to an agreement, Yona takes the lead out of frustration. As a result of Applejack and Rainbow constantly deferring to each other's judgment, the class becomes lost. Smolder flies up and sees the school across a ravine. After even further lack of agreement between Rainbow and Applejack, they eventually decide to build a bridge across the ravine, resulting in yet   disagreement over what to build the bridge out of.

Applejack and Rainbow are very impressed by the teamwork their students demonstrated while saving them.

The students commend Applejack and Rainbow Dash for their bizarrely genius technique of showing them how   to work together so they would learn to do the opposite. Because of this, they nominate both Applejack and Rainbow for the next Teacher of the Month vote. Twilight is thrilled to know her field trip idea was a success and says she'll schedule another one soon.

However, Spike behaves oddly around Rarity, hiding something on his face from her. When she notices and presses him, he reveals he has a red, itchy, pimple-like blemish called a stone scale. Rarity tells Spike the occasional blemish is nothing to be embarrassed about and suggests asking   for a medicinal cream to get rid of it. When Spike and Rarity find Peewee's parents and no Peewee, Rarity believes he moved out, saying everyone has to leave the nest eventually. Peewee suddenly arrives, fully matured, but when he and Spike share a hug, it irritates Spike's stone scale. Rarity again suggests seeing Zecora, but Spike is certain his stone scale will clear up after a good night's sleep.

As Spike hurries through showing the tour group around the school, his voice suffers random and extreme shifts in volume, causing him to speak either very softly or very loudly. His loudness disturbs the students in the library, and a sudden bout of indigestion causes him to burn through his own disguise and expose his stone scales to everyone around him.   later finds Spike hiding in a school closet and recognizes his symptoms as a developmental stage for adolescent   called the ""molt"".   Smolder explains that the molt is different from     in that all dragons go through it during adolescence.

As Twilight flies up to attack the roc and save Rarity and Zecora, Spike's molt continues to progress. His uncontrollable itchiness subsides, but he suddenly gets encased in a stone-like cocoon. When the cocoon breaks, Spike emerges with a pair of dragon wings. With his newfound ability to fly, Spike soars up to help Twilight save Rarity and Zecora from the roc. Spike distracts the roc and overwhelms it with fire, causing it to drop Rarity and Zecora, and Twilight and Spike swoop down to carry them to safety. While Twilight, Rarity, and Zecora are overjoyed by Spike's new wings, Spike is saddened that going through the molt means he'll have to leave his home as part of the ""molt effect"".

As Trixie teaches the school students about the friendship element of magic, Discord—pretending to be a student himself—interrupts the lesson with rude phone calls and sabotages Trixie's magic act by causing her to pull an   out of her hat. Discord causes a similar disruption by summoning a bugbear to chase the students during P.E. When   nearly gets hurt during Discord's lesson, Starlight Glimmer intervenes and angrily scolds him for endangering students and trying to sabotage her headmare duties. However, Discord continues to antagonize Starlight and openly questions her capabilities, and in a fit of frustration, Starlight magically banishes him from the school grounds. Starlight begins to question her own abilities as headmare and wonders why her being in charge upsets Discord so much.    Later that day, the Spell-venger Hunt begins, and Starlight explains the game's rules and splits the students up into teams of two. As the students split up to locate the cultural artifacts and treasures hidden around the school, Starlight and Spike go to the observatory to watch from above.   and   find the Helm of   mounted on a pony suit of armor, but the armor suddenly comes to life and attacks them. Elsewhere,   and   find the Crown of   behind a painting in the library, but all of the paintings come to life and attack the students as well. As she watches this, Starlight quickly deduces Discord to be the cause, explaining to Spike that she only banished Discord's physical form from the school and that Discord is still able to cause trouble in ghost form. Spike wonders how they are going to stop Discord if magic failed to stop him, and Starlight says she isn't going to use magic this time.   As Discord menaces more students with his ghostly mischief, the school erupts into chaos as the students start to believe it is haunted. When Starlight and Spike arrive and reveal Discord to be causing trouble again, Discord appears with all of the artifacts from the Spell-venger Hunt. When he refuses to stop causing trouble for Starlight, Starlight unbanishes his physical form from the school. Thinking as a guidance counselor instead of a headmare, she apologizes for making him feel left out of the school activities and offers him the position of vice headmare, which he eagerly accepts. With peace made between the two, Discord helps set everything back up for the Spell-venger Hunt.   The Mane Six return from their trip and reveal that Discord cast a spell on their cutie marks that sent them on a fake friendship mission. Twilight thanks Starlight for looking after the school while they were gone, and Discord is disappointed that he's no longer the vice headmare.     "

Twilight officially dismisses the students for winter vacation and tells the Young Six to pack up so they can travel home for the holidays. As   wonders what his Hearth's Warming presents are, a cloaked figure sneaks onto the rafters and pours magical powder onto the Hearth's Warming tree, causing the Fire of Friendship to fizzle out and the Hearth's Warming decorations to be covered in purple, glue-like slime. Twilight,  , and Spike spot the cloaked figure as they make their getaway, and as they give chase, they notice the culprit retreat into the student dorms.   Inside the dorms, the Young Six come out of their rooms while packing for winter break and ask what's going on. Twilight, Rainbow, and Spike show them the mess that the cloaked figure made in the school lounge and reason that one of the Young Six did it because there's no other exit out of the student dorms. The students all plead innocence, and despite Twilight giving the culprit a chance to be honest and take responsibility, no one steps forward. Therefore, Twilight makes all of the students clean up the mess while she and Rainbow Dash interrogate them one-by-one, with the guilty party being forced to stay at the school during winter break for extra  . She adds that if no one confesses, then all of the students will have to stay at school for winter break.

She tells her friends a story about how she and her fellow   started celebrating the holiday and adopted its various traditions, albeit a little bizarrely and literally than other  . Twilight and Rainbow Dash call Ocellus into the office next, and Gallus also claims to be innocent of pulling the prank. As   gets increasingly frustrated over not being able to celebrate the holidays with her fellow yaks, she explains that the yaks celebrate a different holiday called ""Snilldar Fest"", which the yaks celebrate by gathering a large pile of objects and spend an entire day smashing them. She then tells her friends a story about her and her family celebrating Snilldar the previous year.   Ocellus soon returns, and   is called into Twilight's office next.

Sandbar returns, and   is called into Twilight's office next. Smolder and Yona tell Sandbar to take the blame for the prank since he already lives in  , but Sandbar refuses and would rather spend the holidays with his family. He then tells a story about a previous Hearth's Warming where his crocheted doll nearly fell into the fireplace. Finally, both Smolder and Yona are called into the office, and the rest of the students fear being unable to go home for the holidays if none of them confesses soon.

Gallus is so unfamiliar with the concept of family that he doesn't know what ""cousins"" are. Smolder and Yona return to the lounge, and since no one confessed to the prank, they all fear being stuck at school for the holidays. Silverstream and Ocellus start to cry about not being able to see their families, and the others begin turning on one another, with Silverstream suggesting the possibility of there being more than one culprit. As a loud argument breaks out among them, Gallus breaks it up and remarks how lucky his friends are to have loved ones to spend the holidays with and share stories with.   Gallus explains that  's ""Blue Moon Festival"" is the only time of year when   aren't mean to each other. When Silverstream says Gallus at least gets to spend it with his family, he reveals that he doesn't have a family and never felt like he had a place in Griffonstone. He also admits that he's the one who pulled the prank because he doesn't want to go home for winter break and wanted to stay with his friends for a little longer. He states that he's only confessing now so that his friends would stop fighting and be allowed to go home to be with their families.   Before Gallus can confess what he did to his teachers, Twilight, Rainbow Dash, and Spike appear, having heard the whole thing from outside the room. While Twilight commends Gallus for his honesty, she states that he still has to take responsibility for his actions, which means staying at school during winter break for extra friendship lessons. Silverstream, Ocellus, Yona, Sandbar, and Smolder offer to stay with Gallus at the school so that he won't be lonely. Realizing that their students don't need extra lessons after all, Twilight and Rainbow invite the Young Six to a holiday dinner with the rest of the Mane Six, and the students happily accept.     "

At the  , after reading Star Swirl's postcard, Twilight expresses to   that if Star Swirl truly wants to learn about friendship, he could enroll at her school.   enters Twilight's office with a mail delivery: a large stack of crates with sewing machines that Rarity plans to use for her friendship classes, and a stack of flyers. When Twilight looks at the flyers, she is shocked to discover that there is   School of Friendship located in  .    As news about Friendship University circulates around the school, particularly its promise of teaching friendship in half the time as Twilight's school, Twilight and Rarity decide to investigate. Upon arriving in Las Pegasus, they find that Friendship University doesn't look like a typical educational institution and that it is run by  . Through their signature style of  , Flim and Flam advertise that their university can teach ponies about friendship in half the time as the School of Friendship and use Twilight's presence in the audience as proof of its legitimacy. When they also mention that the school is about to be officially accredited,   of the E.E.A. appears, much more accepting of Flim and Flam's school than Twilight's due to its pony-only environment.   When Twilight casts suspicion on Flim and Flam's teaching skills because of their past actions, Neighsay accuses her of trying to undermine the competition and monopolize friendship lessons. As Flam oversees student enrollments, Flim and Neighsay give Twilight and Rarity a tour of the university. When Twilight continues to doubt Flim and Flam's true motives, Flim tries to convince her otherwise by revealing that Star Swirl the Bearded is enrolled at the university. Upon seeing Star Swirl enrolled as a student, Neighsay is fully convinced and gives Flim and Flam's school full E.E.A. accreditation. Twilight is heartbroken that her idol would enroll at Flim and Flam's friendship school instead of hers, but Star Swirl states he is simply following what Twilight taught him about friendship and giving the Flim Flam brothers a chance to change their ways, especially since they don't even charge money for classes. However, Twilight still firmly believes that Flim and Flam are up to something.    In order to find out what Flim and Flam are truly up to, Rarity employs her investigative skills and knowledge of   novels to disguise herself and Twilight as university students—though Twilight's disguise consists only of an eye patch and a sticky note over her  . Twilight tells Rarity to enroll in some classes and find out what Flim and Flam are teaching while she looks around the rest of the school. In Flam's class, Rarity—going by the alias ""Plainity""—discovers that fundamentals of friendship such as generosity are part of the lessons, and when she expertly demonstrates generosity for the class, Flam chooses her to be his star pupil. Meanwhile, Twilight sneaks into Flim and Flam's office to dig up dirt on the brothers. However, all she finds are lesson plans that are true to the core values of friendship, and she is unable to find any proof that Flim and Flam are scamming ponies.   All of a sudden, Flim and Flam appear and catch Twilight in the act of trying to undermine their university, and they take a photograph of her doing so. Flim and Flam tell Twilight to stop investigating their school, or else they will leak the photograph to the press, destroy Twilight's reputation, and ensure that no one else enrolls at the School of Friendship. When Star Swirl appears with a completed stack of worksheets for Flim and Flam, he discovers what Twilight is doing and expresses his utter disappointment in her. Backed into a corner by Flim and Flam's blackmail, Twilight begrudgingly agrees to their terms.   Rarity garners a considerable amount of popularity with the other university students in her ""Plainity"" persona. When Twilight regroups with her, she explains what happened in Flim and Flam's office and admits that she is a little jealous that Star Swirl enrolled at their school instead of hers. As she considers the possibility that Flim and Flam really have turned over a new leaf, Rarity decides to return the sewing machines she purchased so she can buy more worksheets from Flim and Flam. Twilight realizes that while Flim and Flam don't charge money for ponies to enroll at their school, they charge exorbitantly for the student worksheets. After watching Flim and Flam charge a student all the bits he has for their lesson worksheets, Twilight decides to risk her reputation for the sake of exposing the brothers' scam. She follows Flim and Flam to their office and sees them enter a secret room, where they funnel the money they got from their students into the expansion of their Las Pegasus resort. Twilight enters and exposes the brothers' true plans. Caught in their deception, Flim and Flam try to make a deal with Twilight—she keeps their plans secret, and they don't leak her incriminating photo to the press. Twilight refuses, saying her reputation isn't worth it if ponies are being taken advantage of.   Pressed about their lesson plans, Flim and Flam reveal that they simply copied from Twilight's School of Friendship guidelines. When Twilight suggests returning the money to the students and teaching friendship lessons for real, Flim and Flam refuse and state they almost have enough money to realize their goal. However, Rarity and Star Swirl suddenly enter, and having overheard everything Flim and Flam just confessed, Star Swirl demands that they refund the students' money and close Friendship University.   As Flim and Flam return the money they collected from the university students, Star Swirl commends Twilight for once again being an upstanding example in friendship, including risking her reputation in order to stand up for what she believes in.

Eager to be an example for the school students, Rarity agrees and goes to Twilight's classroom, where she discovers that Rainbow Dash had been called upon for the same reason she was. Twilight, teaching the students about compromise in friendship, explains that Rarity and Rainbow Dash perfectly exemplify compromise by finding time to spend together even though they have different interests and jobs. However, when asked how they are going to spend their day together, the two are unable to agree on an activity, with Rarity wanting to go shopping and Rainbow Dash wanting to play buckball.   questions further how the two can be friends if they have nothing in common.   Rainbow and Rarity cite the mutual friends they share and the times Rainbow   and Rarity  , but they are unable to think of anything else. Starlight Glimmer states that friendships sometimes cannot be explained and must be seen in action.    Rainbow Dash and Rarity proceed with their day out together, and Twilight and her students observe them from the side to watch their friendship in action. The two start out by playing a game of buckball against  's   team. However, Rarity is too preoccupied with designing a line of buckball-themed leisure wear to focus on the game, much to Rainbow's frustration. Afterward, the two go shopping at a clothing store, but Rainbow gets annoyed by all the glittery stuff on display and incredibly bored when Rarity takes so long picking what boots to purchase. Later, Rainbow Dash and Rarity go  -collecting in a cave, and they finally start to have fun together at first. But while Rarity is more concerned with collecting gems for a new piece of clothing she's working on, Rainbow is more concerned with finding hidden treasure. While trying to open what she believes to be a secret chamber, Rainbow accidentally knocks over Rarity's wagon, causing all the gems she collected so far to shatter into pieces.   Rainbow and Rarity's frustration with each other grows even more, with Rainbow accusing Rarity of not caring about anything she likes and vice-versa. Twilight assures the observing students that this is merely a disagreement that even close friends have from time to time, but Rarity and Rainbow are so upset about not liking the same things that they declare their day together—and their friendship—over.    Rainbow Dash and Rarity sit with Starlight Glimmer in her guidance counselor's office and air their multiple grievances about each other. Tired of their constant complaining, Starlight suggests they put themselves in each other's shoes. In the school library, Starlight mentions that since Rainbow likes the   book series and Rarity likes  , they should read each other's favorite book in order to reconnect as friends, and Rarity and Rainbow begrudgingly agree. When Starlight, Rarity, and Rainbow meet up again later to discuss the books they read, Rarity questions the over-the-top action sequences and ridiculous character names in  , and Rainbow critiques the overly detailed and boring clothing descriptions in  . When Rarity mentions certain plot twists in  , Rainbow reveals that she never actually read the book. As their arguing gets even worse, Starlight decides to bring in reinforcements to help resolve the matter.    As Rarity and Rainbow Dash's arguing draws attention from nearby ponies, Starlight returns and alerts them to a problem back at the school. In Twilight's office, Twilight searches frantically for something. When Starlight arrives with Rarity and Rainbow, she explains that the Amulet of Aurora, one of the magical artifacts that   gave to the school, has gone missing. She explains further that the amulet can control water tides and summon tsunamis and that they must find it before it falls into the wrong hands. With Rainbow Dash's expertise in treasure-hunting and Rarity's knowledge of mystery-solving, Twilight is confident that they can get the amulet back by working together while she and Starlight work on a locator spell. In their inspection of Twilight's office, Rarity finds that the other artifacts are present and untouched, and Rainbow discovers a trail of glitter that leads out of the school and into the nearby woods.   Rainbow recognizes the glitter as Azurantium residue, the same metal from one of the   books, and a clueless Rarity reveals she didn't read Rainbow's book just as Rainbow didn't read hers. Angered that Rarity gave her a hard time earlier for not reading  , Rainbow Dash declares that she is never speaking to her again after they recover the Amulet of Aurora.    As Rainbow Dash and Rarity follow the trail of Azurantium through the woods, Rarity discovers claw prints in the dirt, and Rainbow sees the Azurantium trail lead over a bubbling swamp. With the swamp too deep for Rarity to wade through and the steam geysers too hot for Rainbow to fly over, Rarity constructs a raft out of tree bark and vines. Rainbow is surprised and impressed by Rarity's ingenuity and resourcefulness, and she uses her wings to propel the raft forward, carrying herself and Rarity safely over the swamp. At the other end of the swamp, Rainbow and Rarity lose the trail of Azurantium, and they encounter a  , a large, frog-like creature with six eyes, overly sensitive ears, a soft-speaking voice, and horrible-smelling breath. Rarity and Rainbow ask the Bufogren about the Amulet of Aurora, but they are unable to endure his foul breath long enough to hear him talk. Using some nearby mint leaves and a tuft of cloud collected by Rainbow Dash, Rarity produces a paste that, upon ingestion, leaves the Bufogren's breath smelling minty fresh. They ask him again about the amulet, and the Bufogren points them to a trail of Azurantium leading up the mountain.   Rarity tells Rainbow Dash to fly up and retrieve the amulet, but Rainbow brings Rarity along, not wanting to leave her behind in the swamp. On a ridge up the mountainside, they come across a locked door, and Rarity picks the lock using the stiletto heel of one of her recently purchased boots. Rainbow apologizes to Rarity for the harsh words she said earlier, admitting that some of her interests are actually cool. Likewise, Rarity apologizes for treating Rainbow's interests as less important than her own. The two reconcile with a hug and head through the unlocked door together.   On the other side of the door, Rarity and Rainbow Dash wind up back at the School of Friendship, and at the end of the trail of Azurantium, they find   holding the Amulet of Aurora. Twilight and Starlight reveal that they set up a fake artifact theft to get Rarity and Rainbow to work together and resolve their differences. Rarity and Rainbow admit that they truly needed this lesson, and the students learn that two individuals don't have to love the same things in order to have fun together and that sharing in each other's interests makes their friendship interesting and exciting. With a little time left in their day together, Rainbow and Rarity decide to go shopping for new buckball gear for Rainbow and buckball fan attire for Rarity so she can cheer for Rainbow during games.

Later, Pinkie continues to play her instrument poorly in  , causing anyone who hears to run away in cringing pain.   identifies the instrument as a ""yovidaphone"", a popular instrument from   that produces a pleasant sound when played well. Despite having little talent playing the yovidaphone, Pinkie greatly enjoys playing it, and her friends support her new hobby, believing she will improve her musical talent with enough time.   Unfortunately, Pinkie's yovidaphone playing causes constant disruptions for her friends' daily activities.

As Pinkie drives more ponies away with her poor music, her friends approach her outside  . By this time, Pinkie Pie loves playing the yovidaphone so much, her friends cannot bring themselves to tell her the truth about her poor playing ability. After a bit of dodging the issue, the ponies eventually tell Pinkie that she's terrible at playing the yovidaphone and shouldn't waste her time with something she's bad at.   Pinkie appears visibly shaken by this news at first, but she accepts her friends' advice and agrees to stop playing the instrument, much to her friends' relief. However, as she watches a garbage collector pick up the discarded yovidaphone from her bedroom window that evening, Pinkie Pie is revealed to be completely heartbroken over her decision.    The next day, Twilight and   enter the Ponyville marketplace and find Pinkie Pie sulking. As a result of her decision to stop playing the yovidaphone, her coat has lost some of its color, and her mane and tail have gone flat.

However, when Twilight teleports them into Pinkie's bedroom, they discovery that all of her belongings are gone, having been packed up by her sister  . Maud explains that Pinkie asked her to pack up her things and bring them to the   rock farm because she's decided to move away to Yakyakistan and appreciate yovidaphone music by those who can actually play the instrument. Unable to accept Pinkie's sudden decision to leave, Twilight and the others resolve to go to Yakyakistan and convince her to come back home.    Upon arriving in Yakyakistan, the ponies follow the sound of beautiful yovidaphone playing to a yak hut, where a yak named   is playing music on a stage and Pinkie Pie is drowning her sorrows in ice cream sundaes. When her friends approach and try to get her to return home, Pinkie quickly agrees to do so. Unfortunately, her sour mood doesn't change because hearing good yovidaphone music makes her feel miserable about her lack of talent. As Yigrid takes a break from playing and asks Pinkie to watch her yovidaphone for her, Pinkie looks slightly happy casually playing a few notes, but she quickly stops before her friends get upset. Twilight and the others realize they were wrong to make Pinkie stop doing something she enjoys so much, and they encourage her to continue playing the yovidaphone as long as it makes her happy. Pinkie Pie is nervous about playing poorly in front of a crowd of yaks, but her friends urge her to play nonetheless.   With her friends' support, Pinkie takes the stage and starts playing the yovidaphone just as poorly as always, and the color in her coat and mane returns. When she finishes playing, the yaks unexpectedly cheer and applaud. Yigrid returns from her break and tells Pinkie that as long as playing the yovidaphone makes her happy, any amount of playing—no matter how bad it sounds—is perfect. Overjoyed, Pinkie keeps playing music for her friends and audience.      "

Their frustration and anger toward each other eventually results in Trixie letting Starlight have the entire caravan to herself while she sleeps outside in the bushes so that they can each have their space. Hoo'Far overhears their loud arguing from his own caravan. The next morning, Trixie awakens to discover her caravan is gone. When Starlight emerges from her good night's sleep in Hoo'Far's caravan, she reveals that she traded Trixie's caravan for his. Even though she kept all of her personal belongings and magic supplies in the exchange, Trixie breaks down in tears over losing her precious caravan, and Starlight accuses her of valuing her caravan more than their friendship. Trixie angrily berates Starlight for trading her caravan away and regrets inviting Starlight on the road trip, and Starlight decides to take Hoo'Far's caravan and return home to Ponyville.   As Trixie continues on to Saddle Arabia alone, dragging her luggage along with her, she once again runs into Hoo'Far, who has made himself at home in Trixie's old caravan. Trixie demands that Hoo'Far reverse their caravan trade, and she lies in the road to stop him from leaving unless he agrees. Meanwhile, Starlight has considerable difficulty pulling Hoo'Far's caravan back to Ponyville by herself, and she encounters a pair of mailponies who had similar disagreements earlier and were inspired by Starlight and Trixie's song to make amends.   When Starlight catches up with Trixie and Hoo'Far, Starlight apologizes to Trixie for trading away something that wasn't hers to trade away in the first place, and she asks Hoo'Far for a trade reversal. Hoo'Far agrees to reverse the trade if Starlight and Trixie can demonstrate what good friends they are. Starlight and Trixie attempt to convince Hoo'Far of this by performing their own, awkward version of Twilight and Cadance's ""sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake"" dance. Despite the clumsy and impromptu nature of Starlight and Trixie's friendship dance, Hoo'Far agrees to a reverse exchange of the caravans. However, he advises that they return to Ponyville instead of continuing on to Saddle Arabia in their exhausted condition.   Back in Ponyville, Starlight apologizes again for ruining their trip to Saddle Arabia, but Trixie remarks that even time spent on the road by herself can be irritating. Nonetheless, Starlight is glad that they made the attempt, and Trixie agrees, believing the experience made their friendship stronger than ever.      "

In this episode,   becomes enamored with the Washouts, a touring group of stunt ponies, and   is concerned for her safety and worries that Scootaloo's days as her number one fan are over.   According to supervising director  , ""There were a lot of technical challenges in [this episode]."" This episode was released on France's     on-demand service on August 15, 2018,  twenty-four days ahead of its scheduled premiere on Discovery Family. It also aired on   in Australia on August 19, 2018  and on Nickelodeon in  ,   and   on August 21, 2018.     The episode begins at the  ' clubhouse, with   calling a meeting of the   Fan Club to order and Rainbow Dash herself spying on the meeting from outside. As soon as she calls the meeting to order, however, Scootaloo very quickly rushes through the meeting and dismisses the other club members from the clubhouse, much to Rainbow's confusion. Once alone in the clubhouse, she takes down all of the Rainbow Dash memorabilia and puts up new memorabilia in its place before calling to order the first meeting of the ""Washouts Fan Club""—of which Scootaloo is currently the only member. Having watched from outside, Rainbow Dash barges in and demands to know what's going on. Despite her attempts to hide her new fan obsession, Scootaloo admits that she is branching out into other fan clubs aside from Rainbow's. She explains that the Washouts are a new troupe of stuntponies that perform stunts far more extreme and dangerous than those performed by the  . Rainbow Dash is shocked and worried that Scootaloo no longer finds the Wonderbolts—and her by extension—interesting.   Later, Rainbow Dash tells the rest of the Mane Six about Scootaloo's new interest and worries that Scootaloo doesn't think she's cool anymore. In order to find out why Scootaloo is so obsessed with the Washouts,   suggests that Rainbow Dash attend one of their shows, which they are holding in   that weekend.    That weekend, Rainbow Dash, Scootaloo, and their friends go to the stadium where the Washouts' show is being held, with the seats almost completely packed, and Rainbow Dash makes no effort in hiding her bitterness toward this new stunt troupe. As the show begins, a loud announcer introduces the Washouts, and a trio of   appears in black and green flight suits. With flashy and fiery showmanship, the Washouts impress the crowd by flying through flames and electrically-charged hoops, shooting themselves out of cannons, and soaring through obstacle courses filled with spikes and saw blades. Even Rainbow Dash admits that she is very impressed. At the end of the show, Rainbow Dash takes Scootaloo to meet the Washouts in person, including the thrill-seeking   and the very short-tempered  . When Rainbow introduces herself as one of the Wonderbolts, Rolling Thunder reveals that the Washouts themselves used to be cadets at the   before they were kicked out, hence their team name. Just then, the Washouts' leader appears, and when she removes her helmet, she is revealed to be Rainbow's former lead pony  .   Despite Lightning Dust's bitterness toward Rainbow Dash over her dismissal from the Academy, she claims that her dismissal is what led to her founding the Washouts in the first place, and Scootaloo is greatly impressed with her death-defying stunts. Lightning Dust brags about the Washouts' recklessness and disregard for safety, and she disparages the Wonderbolts for their strict rules and regulations. Lightning Dust mentions that there is an open spot on her team, and Scootaloo expresses great interest in joining, but Rainbow Dash forbids it, and Lightning Dust points out that she has to be kicked out of the Wonderbolts first in order to qualify. When Scootaloo considers joining the Wonderbolts just so she can immediately drop out, Rainbow takes her out of the stadium. She decides to show Scootaloo what the other Wonderbolts think about the Washouts.    At the Wonderbolt Academy, Scootaloo is unimpressed by the Wonderbolts' flight formations, remarking that the Washouts' stunts are more impressive. When Rainbow Dash mentions Scootaloo's interest in joining the Washouts to  , Spitfire very loudly explains to the filly that the Washouts' stunts are incredibly dangerous and can result in serious and severe bodily harm. Back to the Crusaders' clubhouse, Rainbow apologizes to Scootaloo for Spitfire's intense directness and says she is only looking out for Scootaloo's safety. However, Scootaloo is insulted that Rainbow Dash is trying to tell her what she can and cannot do. Rainbow Dash goes about getting rid of all of Scootaloo's Washouts merchandise and putting the merchandise of herself back up, but in the middle of this, she notices that Scootaloo has left.   As she flies into town searching for her, Rainbow runs into  , who has also become a fan of the Washouts after seeing their show. When asked if she knows where Scootaloo is, Twilight says Scootaloo has gone to see the Washouts practice. On their way to the Washouts' stadium, Rainbow expresses frustration that her attempts to deter Scootaloo from wanting to join the Washouts keep falling on deaf ears. Twilight tells Rainbow that she cannot control what Scootaloo does and can only be a good role model to her and hope she makes the right decisions.   At the Washouts' practice stadium, Rainbow Dash meets with Lightning Dust again. Swallowing her pride, she asks Lightning Dust if she has seen Scootaloo. Lightning Dust reveals, much to Rainbow's horror, that Scootaloo has joined the Washouts as their newest member. Rainbow Dash tries to drag Scootaloo away and make her quit, but Scootaloo pulls away, saying she doesn't need Rainbow to look out for her and has given up trying to be just like Rainbow because she can't fly. However, Scootaloo still wants to impress others by doing stunts and tricks like the Washouts, and she refuses to listen to Rainbow Dash's attempts to change her mind. Remembering Twilight's words from earlier, Rainbow accepts that Scootaloo has to make and learn from her own decisions, and she watches with disappointment as Scootaloo leaves with her new team members.    Later that evening, the Washouts hold another stunt show in Ponyville for Scootaloo's official debut. For her debut as a stuntpony, Scootaloo plans to ride her rocket-propelled scooter down a steep hill and fly off a ramp over twenty-two burning wagons. As Lightning Dust flies Scootaloo to the top of the hill, Scootaloo mentions how much she admires Lightning Dust, to the point of starting the first Washouts fan club. When Scootaloo sees the untested rocket up close, she starts to have second thoughts about doing the stunt, but Lightning Dust pressures her to live up to the expectations of the president of Lightning's fan club. The wagons for Scootaloo's stunt are set on fire, and Lightning Dust engages the scooter's rockets, causing Scootaloo to race down the hill at high speed. As she rockets up the ramp and into the air, a rope gets caught on one of the scooter's wheels. All of a sudden, Rainbow Dash appears, zooms past Lightning Dust, and saves Scootaloo from the out-of-control rocket scooter. When she brings Scootaloo back down to the ground, Lightning Dust expresses her great displeasure at Scootaloo for backing out of the stunt. Just then, the other end of the rope caught on the rocket scooter snags Lightning Dust's leg, and she proclaims her lifelong rivalry with Rainbow Dash as she gets dragged off into the sky.   Scootaloo apologizes to Rainbow Dash for not listening to her about Lightning Dust and the Washouts, and Rainbow Dash apologizes in return for not being a better role model and making Scootaloo feel like she'll never accomplish anything worthwhile. She proposes that the Washouts Fan Club be disbanded and a brand-new fan club be established instead. Some time later, in the Crusaders' clubhouse, Rainbow Dash calls to order the first meeting of the ""Scootaloo Fan Club""—of which Rainbow is the founder and president and her parents   are members.

They return to studying, but after hearing Cozy Glow's words, they get upset at each other over trivial matters, and some of them start to wonder if friendship is truly in their nature.    Just then, the students hear a strange sound at the far back of the library, and they follow it to an open floor grate with a mysterious crystal root sticking out of it. Inside, they find a large cavern filled with more crystal roots, and they encounter what appears to be Twilight, but she glows and speaks to them in a bizarre, mystical tone. This ""Twilight"" senses that the Young Six are ""not one"", and they tell her that they don't know if friendship is truly in their nature. ""Twilight"" doesn't accept this and decides to give the Young Six a test. If they fail to pass the test before morning, they will remain trapped in the caves forever.

Inside his small, shrinking enclosure, an increasingly panicked Gallus assures himself that if this is a test, there must be a solution. He realizes that there are two different colors of lights shining in—touching the pink lights makes the enclosure shrink, and touching the blue lights makes it widen. After touching enough of the blue lights, Gallus makes the enclosure wide enough for him to squeeze out through a small opening before he gets crushed. Meanwhile, Smolder's flights through the cave tunnels keep circling her back to the tea party with the two mares. She asks them what she has to do in order to pass her test and escape, and they hint that she likes cute things, but fears admitting it, due to her tough dragon exterior. Begrudgingly, Smolder puts on a cute dress and joins the mares' tea party. Elsewhere, Yona tries to escape the nest of hundreds of spiders. When they corner her, she screams in terror, causing the spiders to back away a little.

When he mentions wanting to go and find his friends, ""Rarity"" and ""Rainbow Dash"" tell him to figure out where his loyalty truly lies. When Smolder finds Ocellus, Ocellus—still in the form of Queen Chrysalis—is unable to change back to her own form, believing she cannot escape the changelings' terrible past. Smolder assures Ocellus that she has changed for the better, and in an effort to help her overcome her fear, Smolder herself admits that she likes cute things. With Smolder's help—and the promise of being invited to a secret tea party—Ocellus conquers her fears and changes back to normal.   In another part of the caves, Gallus finds Silverstream cowering in fear, believing the Storm King and his forces are going to terrorize her and her fellow   again. Gallus tells Silverstream that the shadows are just illusions, and he helps her overcome her fear by admitting to his own fear of small spaces. With Gallus's encouragement, Silverstream angrily tells the shadows off, causing them to vanish. With both of their fears conquered, Gallus and Silverstream head to find the rest of their friends.   At the caves' entrance, Gallus and Silverstream meet up with Ocellus and Smolder, but Yona and Sandbar are nowhere to be found, and the entrance is slowly closing.

Still traveling the caves with ""Rarity"" and ""Rainbow Dash"", Sandbar stops and refuses to go any further without the rest of his friends. ""Rarity"" and ""Rainbow Dash"" accuse Sandbar of caring more about his friends than he does about the rest of Equestria. However, Sandbar argues back that he has always admired his teachers because of the values of friendship they uphold, and he refuses to abandon his friends just to make his teachers proud. Because of this, Sandbar passes his test, and ""Rarity"" and ""Rainbow Dash"" vanish just as the rest of the Young Six arrive.

Just then, ""Twilight"" appears before them again, and they realize it is not Twilight but a spiritual manifestation of the Tree of Harmony itself. The Tree explains that, as it grows, so do its abilities. It also explains that the Young Six themselves chose how their biggest fears manifested and that they overcame their fears for each other's sake.   Because the Young Six passed the Tree of Harmony's test of friendship, they are finally able to return to the school library. There, they explain to Cozy Glow what they experienced underneath the school. They consider telling the Mane Six about what they found, but Cozy begs them not to, realizing it was her words that set off this chain of events in the first place and fearing she might get expelled because of it. The Young Six, exhausted from their ordeal, agree not to tell anyone. They suddenly remember their upcoming test but are too tired to continue studying. As they start to fall asleep, Cozy offers to tell Twilight that they helped her organize the library books so that she'll give them a test extension. The Young Six thank Cozy for her help, and as they fall asleep together, Cozy apologizes for the trouble she inadvertently caused. The episode ends with Cozy Glow looking inside the floor grate and gazing at the Tree of Harmony's glow with great interest.     "

As of this episode, the Hasbro Studios logo at the end of the closing credits is replaced by the new Allspark Animation logo. When asked on Twitter in October 2018 about male Kirin, supervising director   replied, ""The only difference is the eyelashes. We didn't have time/resources to build full different male Kirin models.""  In a November 2018 Q&A on Twitter, Miller stated that he wanted to include the Kirin in the show ever since character designer   sent him her initial designs.     At the  , the   has summoned   and   for their second friendship mission after their   to  . This time, the Map is sending the two to a remote location in   called the  .   explains that the Peaks are inhabited by a race of kind and honest creatures called   and frightening monsters of living fire called Nirik. Despite Fluttershy's reservations about going, Applejack is certain that they can solve whatever friendship problem they have been summoned for. When Applejack and Fluttershy arrive at the Peaks of Peril   station, a deranged ticket-selling pony warns them that only uncharted territory and wild beasts await them beyond the station. Applejack wants to reach the top of the Peaks as soon as possible, which involves trekking through miles of hazardous terrain, but Fluttershy stops to interact with the local  . After a brief breakdown in communication, Fluttershy shows Applejack a shortcut through the mountains that the animals told her about.   Applejack and Fluttershy end up in a small village where they encounter the pony-like Kirin. However, when they try to communicate, the Kirin are completely silent and expressionless, responding only to yes-or-no questions. Unable to figure out what the friendship problem is, Applejack asks if there's anyone in the area that she can talk to, and the Kirin point her on a path leading out of the village. Applejack decides to investigate while Fluttershy stays in the village to try and get more information from the Kirin.   On the outskirts of the Kirin village, Applejack runs into yet another Kirin. She gets frustrated when this Kirin appears just as silent as the others, but the Kirin is revealed to actually be very talkative. Excited to finally be able to talk to someone, the Kirin introduces herself as   and takes Applejack to her small cottage home that oversees the entire mountain range. She states that she hasn't talked to anyone ever since she and her fellow Kirin took an oath of silence. Through  , Autumn Blaze explains that the Kirin were once very sociable creatures that loved to talk, sing, and tell jokes. However, a fight broke out between two Kirin one day, and hurtful words were exchanged. The two Kirin's bodies were ignited in fire by their anger, and their arguing quickly spread to the rest of the village, causing everything to go up in flames. To prevent this from happening again, the village leader   ordered the Kirin to step through the Stream of Silence, suppressing their voices and emotions.   Though the village was rebuilt and peace was restored, Autumn Blaze grew bored of the endless silence. One day, she stumbled into a bed of   flowers, and she brewed them into a tea that restored her ability to speak. Once again able to express herself vocally, she tried numerous times to talk to her friends, but they rejected her. Rain Shine eventually forced Autumn Blaze to choose between staying with the Kirin in silence or keeping her voice and leaving the village, and Autumn chose to leave. Applejack, shocked to learn that the Kirin suppressed their emotions just to avoid hurting each other, realizes this is the friendship problem that she and Fluttershy were summoned to solve. She decides to talk to the Kirin and convince them to restore their voices and let Autumn Blaze return to the village, but Autumn says she used all the foal's-breath flowers to restore her own voice and no new flowers have grown since then. Applejack promises to solve this dilemma and heads back to the village.    Back at the Kirin village, Applejack regroups with Fluttershy, who has also figured out what the friendship problem is. Fluttershy explains much of what Applejack already found out from Autumn Blaze: the Kirin are usually kind and peaceful, but when they lose their temper, they transform into Nirik—creatures of fire and pure rage. Applejack thinks the Kirin shouldn't stop communicating just to avoid hurting each other's feelings, but Fluttershy thinks they should or else they'll risk destroying their village again and endangering the surrounding forests and animals. Like earlier, Applejack and Fluttershy's disagreement turns into a loud argument, drawing the attention of the Kirin. Fearing their arguing could result in the village's destruction again, the Kirin seize Applejack and Fluttershy and carry them toward the Stream of Silence in order to silence their voices and emotions as well. Before they can do so, Autumn Blaze appears and defends Applejack and Fluttershy in her Nirik form.   Fluttershy is surprised that a Kirin has learned to control their anger, and Autumn Blaze says having emotions is not dangerous—what matters is what one does with them. Autumn addresses her old friends and mentions the laughs and songs they used to share. Applejack and Fluttershy agree that giving up one's emotions just to avoid feeling anger is no way to live and that friends can argue from time to time as long as they don't let it get in the way of their friendship.    Convinced by Applejack and Fluttershy's words, one of the Kirin gestures that she wants the cure that gave Autumn Blaze her voice back, but Applejack says there aren't any foal's-breath flowers left to brew the cure. Luckily, one of the squirrels that Fluttershy met earlier tells her it knows where to find more foal's-breath. It guides Applejack and Fluttershy back to the base of the mountain, where the animals are using foal's-breath for their dens. Applejack apologizes to Fluttershy for getting upset with her earlier, pointing out that her kindness toward the animals helped them find the flowers. Fluttershy points out, however, that Applejack's honesty with the Kirin led to them seeking out the flowers in the first place. The two make amends for their earlier arguments.   Applejack and Fluttershy bring the flowers back to the Kirin village, and Autumn Blaze drops the flowers into the Kirin's drinking water. Upon drinking the water, the Kirin are cured of their silence and able to speak again. Rain Shine thanks Autumn Blaze for helping her and the other Kirin realize anger is a natural part of who they are, and she invites Autumn to move back into the village.

The episode begins outside the  , where   practices more complicated flying maneuvers with  's guidance. However, much like Twilight's  , Spike's attempts are clumsy and unbalanced, causing him to frequently crash. When he wonders why Twilight's flying advice is not working, the observing   says it is because Twilight is teaching him to fly like a  , not a  . Under Smolder's instruction, Spike learns to fly more skillfully and gracefully. Spike thanks Smolder for her help, and Smolder comments that her tips are beginner's techniques that young dragons are usually taught by their  . Later, Twilight approaches Spike in his bedroom and wonders if his being raised by ponies instead of dragons has negatively affected his development. However, Spike is preoccupied with making a ""thank-you"" pillow for Smolder as thanks for her flying lessons.    Spike gives Smolder the throw pillow he made for her, but Smolder is puzzled by the gift because dragons do not typically use pillows. All of a sudden, something plummets out of the sky and crashes into the ground near them. When the smoke clears, it is revealed to be a portly adult dragon with lime green scales named  . As a result of his crash in  , Sludge suffers a broken arm and sprained wings. Sludge dismisses Spike and Smolder at first for being much younger, but upon seeing his difficulty walking and flying, Spike helps him back to Twilight's castle. The Mane Six meet Sludge in the castle throne room and offer to let him stay and recover until he gets back on his feet. Sludge initially refuses to accept help from ponies, but the Mane Six and Spike insist. They mend his broken arm, give him a comfortable room to sleep in, and assist in his physical rehabilitation, much of which he spends pigging out on   and  .   After he makes a full recovery, Sludge thanks Twilight and her friends for all they have done for him. He comments how lucky Spike is to have such great friends, and Spike says ever since he was orphaned as an egg, they have become more than just his friends—they are his family. Sludge, pleased to see how much Spike has thrived in a non-dragon environment, confesses that his arrival in Ponyville was no accident. He reveals that he was specifically searching for Spike.   The Mane Six are shocked to learn that Sludge is Spike's father, and Spike is ecstatic to finally meet one of his birth parents. In the castle throne room, Spike asks Sludge why he was abandoned as an egg. Sludge explains that soon after Spike's mother laid his egg, she was tasked by Dragon Lord   to scout for the dragons' next Great Migration path. This would keep her away from the   for years, and feeling Spike deserved to know his mother, Sludge ventured out to search for her. Sludge's search eventually brought him to the Land of Scale Collectors, a region of   comprised of several floating island prisons and occupied by dragon hunters. When Sludge was caught, he turned himself over to the hunters instead of giving up Spike's egg, and he spent years in captivity not knowing what became of Spike or his mother. Despite Sludge's heartbreaking story, Spike says all that matters is that they are together again.   Spike has a long list of things he has always wanted to do with his father, and Sludge eagerly agrees to do them all with him if it would make him happy. The two play  , exchange   presents, and bake cupcakes together. However, Sludge appears largely disinterested in the father-son activities and hogs all the cupcakes for himself.    When Spike asks Sludge what he wants to do next, Sludge says he is fine with doing whatever Spike wants. He mentions, however, that if he were in Spike's living situation, he would spend all his time acting like a real dragon instead of a dragon raised by ponies. When Spike brings up these concerns with Twilight, Sludge corrects his insensitive remarks by saying he wishes he and Spike had more in common. At Twilight's suggestion, Sludge decides to show Spike some new ways to bring out his inner dragonhood. Through the song  , Sludge teaches Spike how to live like a dragon raised in the Dragon Lands, including getting rid of all his usual castle comforts, renouncing sugary pony-made foods, and even abandoning cleanliness and good hygiene. He also tells Spike to gather everything pony-related that he once enjoyed and give them to Sludge so that he won't be burdened by them. As Spike leaves to collect more ""cushy pony stuff"", Sludge makes himself comfortable in Spike's bedroom.   The next morning, Twilight finds Sludge sleeping in Spike's bed, and Spike arrives with more pony food for Sludge, having spent the previous night outdoors. Later, Twilight and her friends find Spike giving Sludge a pedicure in the castle throne room. Twilight starts to worry that Sludge is just taking advantage of Spike, but Spike is happy to do whatever his father asks for the sake of embracing his inner dragon. He also accuses Twilight of being jealous that he has a real parent now and doesn't need her anymore, breaking Twilight's heart.   Some time later, while skipping rocks in the pond, Smolder finds Spike sleeping outside the  . He explains that he was sleeping outside like dragons typically do, but Smolder mentions how contradictory this is since she herself lives inside the school dorms. When Spike explains what Sludge is making him do, Smolder thinks Sludge is treating Spike like a servant instead of a son. Later, Sludge finds Spike packing things up in his bedroom. Spike says that since Twilight doesn't approve of Sludge living in the castle, he and Sludge will move somewhere else, much to Sludge's dismay. Smolder then arrives, having found a very uncomfortable cave where Spike and Sludge can live together. Sludge starts to panic and says he still has much to teach Spike about being a real dragon, but Spike says Sludge has already taught him so much. As he and Spike fight over a pillow, Sludge confesses that he is   Spike's father and only pretended to be in order to live a life of castle luxury.   Spike is heartbroken by this deception, but Sludge argues that he simply did what any other dragon would have done in the same situation—a point of view that Smolder strongly disagrees with. As Sludge takes his leave, Smolder sympathizes with Spike's struggles of finding out who he really is. He approaches Twilight in the castle library, explains what happened with Sludge, and apologizes for snapping at her earlier. Twilight allows Spike to travel to the Dragon Lands more often to learn more about himself, but Spike says he already knows who his real family is.    "

When she brings up Neighsay's duties as the head of the E.E.A., Neighsay says that protecting the school from threats to Equestria is more important than said duties.

Twilight regrets not being able to teach this to Cozy, but the Young Six argue that they wouldn't have been able to defeat Cozy without Twilight's teachings.

When Twilight asks to ""deliver"" her and her friends to Mount Aris, Celaeno refuses out of fear of suffering the Storm King's wrath. The ponies learn that before the parrots served the Storm King, they used to be sky pirates. Through the song  , Rainbow Dash and her friends encourage the parrots to oppose the Storm King's iron-fisted rule and return to their swashbuckling ways. Inspired by Rainbow's words, the parrots discard their uniforms and raise their ship's rainbow-colored sails. In celebration of the pirates' return to glory, Rainbow Dash performs a   against Twilight's wishes.  In the distance, Tempest sees the rainboom, realizes Capper lied to her, and turns her airship around. As Tempest's ship approaches Celaeno's, the pirates hide Twilight and her friends below deck. Tempest and Grubber board the ship and asks where Twilight is, but Celaeno and her crew claim ignorance. Below deck, Twilight fears the pirates will give them up and comes up with an idea. She opens the hatch on the ship's undercarriage, and the ponies fall through the sky. In midair, Twilight uses a crate, a Storm King flag, and some rope to create a makeshift hot-air balloon, and she and her friends fly toward Mount Aris. Back on Captain Celaeno's airship, Tempest finds Twilight's map and learns of her and her friends' next destination. As punishment for harboring the princess in secret, Tempest destroys Celaeno's ship.    After climbing the long stairs leading up Mount Aris, the Mane Six and Spike finally reach the Hippogriff Kingdom but find it to be abandoned and in ruins. As the ponies start to wonder if their journey was in vain, they hear someone humming and follow the sound to an underground pond. When the humming creature hears the ponies approach, it escapes into the water. Twilight and her friends try to pursue the creature into the pond, but they are suddenly sucked into a whirlpool and trapped in a submerged cavern. Before they drown, magical air bubbles appear to allow them to breathe, courtesy of the creature they encountered earlier. When the creature learns that the Storm King invaded the Mane Six's home and that they are looking for the Hippogriffs, she reveals herself to be a   named  . Understanding the ponies' plight, Skystar takes them to meet her mother.  The ponies find themselves in the underwater kingdom of  , home to the seaponies. In the throne room, Skystar introduces the ponies to her mother  , who is furious to see surface dwellers in her domain. After Skystar vouches for them, Twilight asks what happened to the Hippogriffs, and Skystar tells the story against her mother's wishes. Long ago, the Hippogriffs did indeed live on Mount Aris, but the Storm King invaded their home, and they fled. Skystar reveals that the seaponies are, in fact, the Hippogriffs themselves, transformed by Queen Novo's magical pearl. Novo demonstrates her pearl's power by transforming the Mane Six into seaponies and Spike into a pufferfish. Twilight asks if she can use the pearl to save Equestria from the Storm King, but Novo refuses in order to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. As Novo leaves for her seaweed wrap, Skystar, eager to make new friends, invites the ponies to stay in Seaquestria forever, but they decline, saying their home and families are in Equestria. Though saddened, Skystar understands and leaves. Pinkie Pie feels sorry for Skystar and asks if they can stay a little longer. Twilight unexpectedly agrees and urges Pinkie and the rest of their friends to show Skystar a good time.   Pinkie approaches the sad Skystar and starts singing  , offering to have some fun with her before they leave. Their games together slowly turn into a celebration, and the rest of the seaponies join in. Even Queen Novo gets swept up in the friendship party and decides to trust the outsiders. However, before Novo can offer to do something to help them, an alarm is heard, and Twilight is caught trying to steal Novo's pearl. Novo, hurt and angered by Twilight's deception, banishes her and her friends from Seaquestria.   Back in their original forms, the Mane Six and Spike wash up on the shores of the   near Mount Aris; Twilight's friends are furious with her for trying to steal from the seaponies. Twilight defends her decision by saying they aren't in Equestria, and that their usual methods of resolving problems aren't good enough to save their home. As Pinkie and Twilight get into a heated argument about how little Twilight trusts her friends, Twilight angrily lashes out by saying she'd be better off without friends like them. Twilight tries to take back what she said, but Pinkie refuses to hear it and walks off, with the rest of their friends following after. Spike attempts to comfort Twilight, but she falls into deep remorse over her actions. All of a sudden, Spike gets seized by a Storm Guard. As Twilight tries to save him, Tempest captures her. On Tempest's airship, Tempest taunts Twilight over losing her friends. When Twilight asks Tempest why she's doing this to her fellow ponies, Tempest sings   and reveals her tragic backstory. As a young filly, she was friends with two unicorns named   and  , who lost their ball in the cave of an   while playing one day. When young Tempest tried to retrieve the ball, the ursa broke her horn. Her magic became unstable and dangerous, causing her friends to shun her out of fear.   Tempest learned from then on that friendship is a foolish notion, and she takes Twilight back to Canterlot, where the ponies are still kept in chains and cages, including Songbird Serenade. Tempest returns to the castle with Twilight in tow, just in time for the Storm King's arrival. With the four Alicorn princesses gathered together, the Storm King uses the Staff of Sacanas to steal their magic and make himself even more powerful. Back at the Basalt Beach, the rest of the Mane Six feel bad about abandoning Twilight. As they consider going back to apologize, Spike appears and informs them that Twilight's been captured. The ponies believe there's no way to get back to Canterlot or challenge the Storm King's forces, but Capper suddenly appears with the cavalry: Captain Celaeno and her pirate crew. Princess Skystar, having used Queen Novo's pearl to transform back into a Hippogriff, also joins them—at the risk of getting in trouble with her mother.    With the magic of the Alicorn princesses, the Storm King is excited by his power to control the sun and moon. At the Canterlot city entrance, Capper disguises himself as a pastry chef delivering a congratulatory cake for the Storm King, and the ponies pull the cake cart while pretending to be captured. The gluttonous Grubber sees the cake being carted through town and takes a bite out of it, and he notices the eyeball of someone hiding inside. With their cover blown, Skystar and the pirates burst out of the cake, and a battle breaks out between the ponies' forces and the Storm Guards. The battle reaches the castle courtyard, and Twilight and Tempest look down at it from the balcony. The Storm King is sickened by the ""magic of friendship"" and uses his staff to create a giant lightning storm over Canterlot, forcing Twilight's friends to take shelter. Tempest reminds the Storm King of their deal for him to restore her horn, but the Storm King goes back on his word and reveals that he merely used her for his own ends. The Storm King attacks Tempest, who nearly flies off the balcony and into the cyclone, but Twilight saves her.   The Storm King prepares to finish off both Twilight and Tempest, but the rest of Twilight's friends use Pinkie's party cannon to launch themselves through the cyclone and knock the Storm King over. While Twilight reconciles with her friends, the Staff of Sacanas' magic surges out of control. Together with her friends, Twilight races to seize the staff before the Storm King does, and both Twilight and the King are lost in the raging storm. Just as it appears that Twilight is gone forever, she floats back down with the staff in her possession, much to her friends' relief. Just then, the Storm King returns holding another orb to turn Twilight and her friends to stone. Before he can do so, Tempest jumps in the way, and the orb turns herself and the Storm King to obsidian. Twilight keeps Tempest from falling off the balcony, but the petrified Storm King plummets down and shatters into pieces. The ponies are shocked by Tempest's sacrifice, and Twilight uses the Staff of Sacanas to de-petrify her and the princesses, free the ponies from captivity, and restore Canterlot back to normal.    The Friendship Festival continues, and Songbird Serenade takes the stage to thank Princess Twilight and her friends for saving Equestria. As Songbird performs the song  , Rarity gives Capper a new cape, and Queen Novo and the other Hippogriffs join them—with Novo grounding Skystar for leaving home without permission. In the middle of the festivities, Twilight notices a sad Tempest all by herself. She invites Tempest to stay in Equestria and offers her friendship, but Tempest is still upset about her broken horn. Twilight tells her that her magic is still as powerful as the pony who wields it. In acceptance of their new friendship, Tempest creates fireworks for Songbird Serenade's performance. When Pinkie Pie compliments Tempest's magic display, Tempest reveals her real name: Fizzlepop Berrytwist.   As the ""pointy art""-style   roll, the ponies, their new friends, and the Storm Guards celebrate together, and Songbird Serenade's song transitions to  . As the ending crawl begins, Spike waves goodbye to the departing audience.  , some baby Hippogriffs, as well as Skystar's oyster friends, Shelly and Sheldon, all play with the ending crawl. At the end of the credits, Princess Celestia raises the sun.            A 35-second teaser for the film debuted with the premiere of   on April 7, 2017.

"My Little Pony Best Gift Ever","Michael Vogel","2018-10-27","https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Best_Gift_Ever",",  also titled  ,  and  ,  is a  / -themed one-hour special of   that takes place between seasons eight  and nine. In this special,   and her friends do a ""Hearthswarming Helper"" to get just one   present for another pony, and they race all over   to find the perfect gift.   The holiday special is adapted into the September-October 2018      , ,  and  . A song animatic from the special was shown at the 2018     panel. The promo for the special originally had a layering error involving the reindeer's flight over Twilight's castle. Supervising director   confirmed on Twitter that this was fixed.     The special opens in   one day before   Eve. Everyone in town sings the song   as they decorate their houses for the holidays and buy presents for each other, and  's   students board the   bound for their own respective homes. Throughout the song,  ,  , and   race to get gifts for all of their friends in time, and   and   bring the   and   families together for the holidays at  .  gets particularly stressed out trying to get everything done on her to-do list, including grading her students' tests, preparing for the arrival of  ,  , and  , and decorating the  . In an effort to ease Twilight's workload, Applejack suggests doing a ""Hearthswarming Helper"" this year—instead of getting   presents for all of their friends, each of the Mane Six will get a   present for the pony whose   they pull out of a hat.   After pulling cutie marks out of Applejack's hat, the Mane Six decide to do the gift exchange at Twilight's castle the following night. As they go their separate ways,   wants to get a present for Rarity, but he drew Rainbow Dash's cutie mark instead. At Applejack's suggestion, he seeks out the pony who drew Rarity's cutie mark to try and get them to agree to a trade.    At the Castle of Friendship, with her freed-up schedule time, Twilight is able to focus on decorating before Shining Armor, Cadance, and Flurry Heart arrive. Spike enters wondering if she got Rarity for Hearthswarming Helper, but she got Pinkie Pie and plans to shop for her present later. As Spike leaves, he comments that since each of them is only getting one gift for one of their friends, they have a responsibility to make sure the gift they give is extra special. Twilight decides to decorate later while she puts more planning and thought into Pinkie's present. Meanwhile, at  , Pinkie Pie has just as much trouble figuring out what to get for Twilight, and she asks her sisters  ,  , and   for advice. Limestone suggests simply choosing one present out of a large pile that Pinkie has already wrapped, and Maud suggests giving Twilight a rock. Unsatisfied with their ideas, Pinkie decides to seek out the ""best-at-gift-giving"" yaks in  .   In the middle of town, Spike runs into Rarity and learns that she got Applejack for Hearthswarming Helper, planning to get her a designer western-themed hat from  . Elsewhere, Rainbow Dash—who got Fluttershy for Hearthswarming Helper—tries to subtly guess what Fluttershy would like as a gift, but Fluttershy says she likes everything, making Rainbow Dash cluelessly frustrated. As Rainbow flies off, Spike approaches Fluttershy and learns that she got Rarity for Hearthwarming Helper. Using his wits, he convinces Fluttershy to trade names with him. As he leaves, Applejack appears and asks Fluttershy for help in getting a gift for Spike. Unable to decide on what to get for Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash settles on buying her a candle, but   appears—as the candle itself—to voice his disappointment in her lack of effort. Discord, implying that he is closer to Fluttershy than Rainbow is, offers to accompany Rainbow on her quest to find a present for Fluttershy. Meanwhile, back at the castle, Spike finally has Rarity for Hearthswarming Helper, but...    Fluttershy and Applejack travel to   for the Hearth's Warming Craft Fair, where they hope to find special gifts for Rainbow Dash and Spike. Just before Fluttershy buys a   book for Rainbow, she is drawn to the attention of a stand where a disguised   sell cheaply-made ""Holly the Hearth Warmer"" dolls. With their typical showpony flair, Flim and Flam manage to hustle Fluttershy out of all of her   in exchange for one of the dolls. In Yakyakistan, Pinkie Pie appears before   during the yak celebration of Snilldar Fest and asks where she can find the ""best gift ever"". Rutherford suddenly looks panicked and pulls Pinkie aside so they can talk in privacy. He explains to Pinkie that although yaks assert that they are best at everything, there is one area in which they are not: giving gifts. That honor belongs to the fabled ""Gift Givers of the Grove"", whose location only Rutherford knows, and he entrusts Pinkie—an honorary yak—with a map to their home.   Back in Ponyville, Rarity goes to the post office to pick up her package from Manehattan with Applejack's present. However, due to a mix-up caused by mailpony  , the package was sent to Sweet Acorn Orchard instead of Sweet Apple Acres. To prevent further mishaps, Rarity offers to go to Sweet Acorn Orchard and pick up the package herself. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash continues searching for a present for Fluttershy, but Discord disapproves of all her ideas. Frustrated, she turns to Discord for suggestions, and he suggests a special animal addition to her Sweet Feather Sanctuary. Back at the castle, Twilight tries to find a present for Pinkie Pie that is unique, specific to her personality, and food-based. She eventually settles on pudding and remembers a legendary pudding dish made by   at the very first Hearth's Warming. Unfortunately, the book in which the pudding is mentioned does not contain the recipe for how to make it.    Back at Rainbow Falls, Fluttershy meets up with Applejack and shows her the doll she bought for Rainbow Dash, but Applejack instantly realizes how cheap and poorly-made the doll is. Suspicious about where the doll came from and how much Fluttershy spent for it, Applejack returns to the stand where Fluttershy bought it and, upon peeking behind the back curtains, discovers Flim and Flam putting on disguises.  Meanwhile, Rarity arrives at the remote Sweet Acorn Orchard and meets acorn farmers   and  . When Rarity asks about the package that was mistakenly delivered to their home, Oak Nut and Butternut believe she was the one who sent it and thank her. Their son  —who is just as much into fashion as Rarity—loves the hat and recognizes its quality. Upon realizing who Rarity is, Pistachio becomes starstruck and begs her to join him and his family for a meal. Back at the Castle of Friendship, a frazzled Twilight finally finds the recipe for Chancellor Puddinghead's legendary pudding, which mentions that not meeting the exact measurements of its ingredients will result in ""untold culinary devastation"". However, before Twilight can start making the pudding, Shining Armor, Cadance, and Flurry Heart arrive, and Shining Armor realizes Twilight is stressed about something. Twilight quickly denies this and excuses herself to collect the ingredients for Pinkie Pie's pudding.   In the arctic north beyond Yakyakistan, Pinkie discovers a small house in a mountain grove, where she meets a trio of  . The apparently prophetic reindeer already know who Pinkie is, have been expecting her arrival, and are even able to predict what she is going to say next. They introduce themselves as  ,  , and  —the Gift Givers of the Grove that Pinkie has been looking for. With a cryptic rhyme, the Gift Givers give Pinkie a present for Twilight. When Pinkie looks inside, she does not understand what the gift means, but the Gift Givers tell her she will understand later.   Applejack and Fluttershy confront Flim and Flam over their latest doll-selling scam. The brothers explain that they are raising funds to finance another expansion of their   resort and simply supplying ponies with something to get their friends and family for Hearth's Warming. Despite the dolls' shoddy assembly and Flim and Flam's unscrupulous methods, they are not doing anything illegal or harmful, and they quickly make Applejack and Fluttershy leave. Upset that Flim and Flam are using the holidays for their shifty purposes, Applejack and Fluttershy decide to show their customers a better way. Some time later, they return to Flim and Flam's stand and pretend to be repeat customers. Applejack buys three ""Holly the Hearth Warmer"" dolls for  ,  , and  , but Fluttershy points out that giving the same doll to all three of her family members would depreciate the value of gift-giving. This causes the rest of Flim and Flam's customers to question their own purchasing choices, and they walk away, bringing the brothers' latest scam to an end.   Flim and Flam are eventually run out of Rainbow Falls by angry, ripped-off customers, and Applejack and Fluttershy take the train back to Ponyville. Unfortunately, it is now Hearth's Warming Eve, and they do not have anything special to give Rainbow Dash and Spike, having only the last two of Flim and Flam's ""Holly the Hearth Warmer"" dolls.    Rainbow Dash and Discord search the forest for a small, rare, and elusive creature called a  . Upon finding one, Rainbow Dash quickly and effortlessly catches it. At the castle, Spike makes a present for Rarity from scratch. When he dozes off to sleep in the middle of this, he accidentally covers his entire body in glitter. Back at Sweet Acorn Orchard, Rarity bids farewell to Oak Nut and Butternut and foresees a promising future in fashion for Pistachio. Just before Rarity leaves, Pistachio offers to give the hat back, knowing full well he was not its intended recipient. However, not only does Rarity let Pistachio keep the hat, but she also invites him to be her guest at Manehattan's next Fashion Week. Unfortunately, this leaves Rarity without a gift for Applejack.   In the castle kitchen, Twilight is more preoccupied with carefully making Pinkie Pie's pudding gift than spending time with Shining Armor, Cadance, and Flurry Heart. Twilight admits to getting stressed over making sure her present was perfect and promises to spend time with her family now that her cooking is almost done. However, while Twilight addresses Shining Armor and Cadance, Flurry Heart throws a bunch of additional ingredients into the cooking pot, and as the four of them leave the kitchen, the pudding in the pot starts to boil over. As Rainbow Dash and Discord come out of the forest and approach the castle, Discord bids farewell to Rainbow, having not been invited to spend Hearth's Warming with the Mane Six. Feeling guilty, Rainbow Dash invites Discord to join her and her friends for Hearth's Warming as thanks for helping her find Fluttershy's present, and Discord happily accepts. However, as the sun starts to set, the winterchilla transforms into a giant, monstrous version of itself called a winterzilla.   The Mane Six start to come together at the entrance to Twilight's castle, most of them disappointed in themselves for not getting anything special for their Hearthswarming Helper recipients. Just then, Twilight and her family appear running from a tidal wave of pudding, and Rainbow Dash and Discord appear running from the winterzilla. The Mane Six and their friends find themselves trapped between an impassable wall of pudding and a roaring monster.    The winterzilla is drawn to the sparkly glitter covering Spike's body, and Twilight uses Spike to distract it while some of their friends get to safety. But the winterzilla quickly ignores Spike and starts eating the castle's Hearth's Warming decorations. At Discord's suggestion, Fluttershy reprimands the winterzilla into being submissive and, upon learning it is all alone for the holidays, invites it to spend Hearth's Warming with the ponies. Twilight tries to get the sea of magical pudding under control, but it is resistant to her magic attacks. With Twilight unsure of what to add to the pudding in order to fix Puddinghead's recipe, Pinkie Pie remembers the gift box she received from the Gift Givers of the Grove and their mysterious final message. The gift box contains additional pudding ingredients, and when Pinkie jumps into the pudding with the box, the ingredients merge with the pudding and bring it under control, much to everyone's relief.   A short while later, the Mane Six and their friends enjoy bowls of pudding by the fireplace. Twilight apologizes to Pinkie for failing at Hearthswarming Helper, but Pinkie says if the pudding had not magically come to life, her own Hearthswarming Helper present would not have made sense. The rest of the Mane Six feel equally ashamed of the Hearth's Warming presents they did or did not bring, but their intended recipients quickly forgive them. Though it is unfinished, Spike decides to give Rarity her Hearth's Warming present:   in which he fully puts his feelings for her into words. Rarity is so moved by Spike's song that she thanks him with a kiss on the cheek.  Realizing how much trouble everyone had in finding the perfect Hearth's Warming gift, Pinkie Pie recalls the Gift Givers' cryptic rhyme: ""The best gift is more precious than gold, but it cannot be sold. When it breaks, it's not ended, for quickly it's mended. It can never be bought yet is easily sought."" Twilight recognizes this rhyme as a riddle and reveals that its answer is ""friendship"". In a second verse of Spike's song, Twilight and her friends express that friendship is the greatest gift of all, and multiple ponies are shown across Equestria spending Hearth's Warming together. As the Mane Six and their friends come together for a group hug, the Gift Givers of the Grove observe them from outside the window, and Alice echoes their sentiment as she, Bori, and Aurora gallop across the sky.
